    "actionability": "Extremely actionable - provides step-by-step process, actual prompts, spreadsheet formulas, and specific tools. You could implement this Monday morning.",
    "contrarian_index": "Challenges several orthodoxies: that you should write tests first, that LLM agreement percentages are meaningful, that successful companies don't do evals. Not revolutionary but meaningfully contrarian.",
    "freshness": "Content is current and relevant to AI product builders, but the core concepts (error analysis, systematic measurement) are timeless. Could stay relevant for 2-3 years.",
    "host_quality": "Lenny asks probing follow-ups, manages the technical complexity well for a broad audience, and keeps the conversation focused on practical value rather than theory."
