Welcome to Tech Frontiers. Today we're talking about the latest developments in AI agents and how they're changing software development.

Host: So Sarah, you've been working with AI coding agents for the past six months. What's your take on where we are versus the hype?

Sarah: It's fascinating because we're actually past the "ChatGPT can write hello world" phase. The really interesting shift is that these agents can now maintain context across entire codebases. I was debugging a memory leak last week, and Claude Code traced it through seven different files, understanding the async patterns we were using. That would have taken me hours.

Host: That's a concrete example. But I've heard people say AI can't do "real" engineering work.

Sarah: That's where it gets counterintuitive. The bottleneck isn't the AI's capability anymore—it's our ability to articulate what we want. I've found that the engineers who are most effective with AI agents are the ones who can think in terms of invariants and contracts rather than implementations. It's almost like we're becoming more like product managers for code.

Host: Interesting mental model. What about the economics?

Sarah: Here's something non-obvious: the cost curve is inverting faster than people realize. Three months ago, we were spending $200 per developer per month on AI tools. Now we're at $80, and the capabilities have doubled. My prediction—and this is contrarian—is that within 18 months, AI coding assistance will be cheaper than Stack Overflow was in terms of developer time saved.

Host: You mentioned something about "agentic patterns" before we started recording. Can you explain?

Sarah: Yeah, so there's this emerging pattern I call "specification-first development." Instead of writing code and then tests, you write a detailed specification of what the system should do—almost like a contract—and then you let the AI generate both the implementation and the tests. The key insight is that specs are much more stable than implementations. We're seeing 40% fewer bugs in production using this approach.

Host: That's a specific claim. What's the data behind it?

Sarah: We ran an A/B test with our team over three months. Traditional TDD approach on one set of features, specification-first on another. The spec-first features had 42% fewer post-deployment bugs and took 30% less time to ship. The surprising part was that code review time actually went up by 15%, but the quality gains were worth it.

Host: Let's talk about the stuff that doesn't work yet.

Sarah: Oh, plenty. Multi-file refactoring is still sketchy. The AI agents can suggest changes, but they often miss subtle dependencies. Database schema migrations are another weak point—too easy for the AI to generate something that looks right but has subtle race conditions. And anything involving real-time systems or precise timing constraints is still firmly in human territory.

Host: What should people be learning right now to stay relevant?

Sarah: This is going to sound weird, but the most valuable skill is becoming really good at evaluating code you didn't write. Code review used to be about catching bugs. Now it's about understanding whether the AI's approach is architecturally sound. Also, get really good at prompt engineering—but not the basic stuff. I mean understanding how to decompose complex problems into chains of prompts that build on each other.

Host: Last question: where is this going in the next year?

Sarah: My bet is on personalized coding agents that learn your team's patterns and conventions. Right now, every prompt is stateless. Soon, your AI assistant will know that when you say "add the usual error handling," it means your team's specific approach with structured logging and retry logic. That's when it gets really powerful—when the AI becomes an extension of your team's collective knowledge rather than a generic tool.

Host: Sarah, thanks for sharing such specific insights. Really appreciate you bringing data instead of just vibes.

Sarah: Thanks for having me. And hey, all the code examples from today's discussion will be on my GitHub.
