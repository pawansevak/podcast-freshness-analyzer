      "insight": "Better abstractions compound faster than linear progress - you can recover 'sunk costs' incredibly quickly if you find the right abstraction, like how LispCore systems work with tiny codebases",

    "signal_to_noise": "Very tight editing, minimal rambling. Host asks good follow-ups and Ivan stays focused. Almost no filler or self-promotion.",
    "actionability": "More strategic/philosophical than tactical. Some specific frameworks (sugar-coated broccoli, Lego boxes vs bricks) but limited step-by-step guidance.",
    "contrarian_index": "Multiple takes that go against conventional wisdom - staying lean vs growth-at-all-costs, horizontal vs vertical products, hiring misfits. Genuinely challenges orthodoxy.",
    "freshness": "Mix of timeless principles with some recent AI insights. Could have been recorded anytime in last 2 years. Not cutting-edge but not stale.",
