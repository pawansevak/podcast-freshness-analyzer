    "insight_density": "Strong tactical insights with specific tools and workflows, but limited to AI product development. The conversation-first approach and Claude Artifacts integration are genuinely novel, though some content is tool-specific rather than broadly applicable.",
    "signal_to_noise": "Very tight episode with minimal filler. Host keeps conversation focused on practical demonstrations. Some sponsor content but well-integrated. Almost every minute contains actionable content.",
    "actionability": "Extremely high - provides step-by-step workflows you can implement immediately. Shows actual screens, specific prompts, and tool features. Could replicate the entire process Monday morning.",
    "contrarian_index": "Moderately challenges traditional product development by starting with conversations rather than features, but doesn't take strong controversial positions. More methodological innovation than ideological challenge.",
    "freshness": "References current AI tools and capabilities (Claude Artifacts, Magic Patterns features) that are relatively new. Workflow is adapted for current AI capabilities, though some concepts could age within 12-18 months.",
    "host_quality": "Good interviewer who lets guest demonstrate while providing useful commentary. Asks clarifying questions and draws connections. Could push harder on limitations or challenges."

  "summary": "Priya demonstrates a conversation-first approach to AI product development, starting with example dialogues and working backwards to prototypes. The tactical workflow using Claude and Magic Patterns is immediately actionable for AI PMs, though limited to conversational AI products.",
