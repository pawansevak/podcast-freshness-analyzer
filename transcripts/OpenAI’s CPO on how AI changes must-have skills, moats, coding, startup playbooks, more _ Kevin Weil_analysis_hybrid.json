    {
      "rank": 1,
      "insight": "OpenAI uses ensembles of different models internally (different sizes, fine-tuned versions, reasoning vs speed optimized) for different parts of problems, similar to how companies use different specialized humans for different tasks",
      "timestamp": "59:52",

    {
      "rank": 2,
      "insight": "You can reason about AI product design by thinking 'what would a human do in this situation' - like when designing the 20-second thinking UI, they asked what a human would do (give updates, not go silent, not babble everything)",
      "timestamp": "37:02",
      "why_valuable": "Counterintuitive framework for AI UX that most builders miss - they think AI needs completely new interaction paradigms when human analogies often work better",
      "obviousness_level": "truly_non_obvious"
    },
    {
      "rank": 3,
      "insight": "OpenAI operates with 'model maximalism' - instead of building scaffolding around model limitations, they assume the next model in 2 months will solve current problems, so they build for future capabilities",
      "timestamp": "31:28",
      "why_valuable": "Completely different product strategy than traditional tech - most companies build around current limitations, but in AI you should build ahead of capabilities",
      "obviousness_level": "truly_non_obvious"
    },
    {
      "rank": 4,
      "insight": "Writing evals (tests for AI models) is becoming a core PM skill because you need to know if your model is 60% vs 95% vs 99.5% accurate for your use case - you build completely different products at each level",
      "timestamp": "20:44",
      "why_valuable": "Specific skill most PMs don't know they need - traditional product metrics don't apply when your core technology has probabilistic outputs",

    },
    {
      "rank": 5,
      "insight": "OpenAI has only ~25 PMs for 400M+ users because they deliberately stay PM-light - too many PMs create decks instead of execution, and PM-light forces product-minded engineers to make decisions",
      "timestamp": "48:47",
      "why_valuable": "Contrarian org design at massive scale - most companies would have 10x more PMs, but this explains how they ship so fast",

    "insight_density": "Multiple genuinely surprising insights about how OpenAI actually operates internally - model ensembles, human-analogy design thinking, model maximalism philosophy. Not generic product advice.",
    "signal_to_noise": "Mostly valuable content with some rambling about personal stories, but host keeps things moving. Good editing, minimal filler.",
    "actionability": "Specific frameworks like 'think like a human' for AI UX, concrete eval examples, and tactical advice on fine-tuning. Could implement Monday.",
    "contrarian_index": "Some spicy takes like 'chat is actually the perfect interface' and 'build for future model capabilities not current ones' but not deeply controversial.",
    "freshness": "Very current - references recent launches, discusses cutting-edge AI development practices, uses terminology that emerged in last 6 months.",
    "host_quality": "Good follow-ups, manages time well, asks probing questions about internal operations rather than just surface-level stuff."
