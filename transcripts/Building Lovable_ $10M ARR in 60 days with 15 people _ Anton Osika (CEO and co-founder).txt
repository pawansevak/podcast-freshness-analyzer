lovable is your personal AI software engineer you describe an idea and then you get a fully working product the reason is to enable those who have had like such a hard time finding people who are good at grading software that's been their absolute bottleneck and let them take their ideas and their dreams into reality you guys hit 4 million AR in the first 4 weeks you hit 10 million AR in the first 2 months with just 15 people you're the fastest growing startup in all of Europe how did you decide on lovable as the name it's so sweet the best word for a great product is that it's lovable a lot of jargon that I like to use to like emphasize what we should be striving for is building a minimum lovable product and then building a lovable product and then building an absolutely lovable product so I I took that jargon with me in the company name people wonder just what jobs will be more important what skills will be less important doing a bit of everything being in generalist is I think much more


00:00:54 - 00:02:59
important than it used to be if I'm putting together a product team today I I would really obsess about getting as many skill sets as possible for each person I hire what have you done that has allowed you to grow this fast with so few people people love the product that's the driver of the growth today my guest is Anton OC Anton is co-founder and CEO of lavable which is essentially an AI engineer that takes an English prompt and codes a product for you in minutes you can then talk to it iterate on the product and then launch it to the world it's one of the fastest growing products in history the fastest growing startup in Europe ever and as Anton describes their goal for lovable is for it to be the last piece of software that anybody has to write because it'll be able to create all future products for us they launched just a few months ago in the first 4 weeks hit 4 million ARR in the first 2 months crossed 10 million ARR all with just 15 people absurd in our conversation we covered a lot of


00:02:00 - 00:03:56
including a live demo of lovable how their team operates how they hire what do most enable their team to scale this quickly with so few people Pro tips for using lovable how it all started how he recommends you build product TPS going forward with tools like this existing what skills will matter more and less going forward plus how to think about lovable versus competitors and so much more if you're trying to wrap your head around how product building will change with the rise of AI tools this episode is a mustat if you enjoy this podcast don't forget to subscribe and followed in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube also if you become a yearly subscriber of my newsletter you now get a yearfree of perplexity and notion and superhuman and linear and granola check it out at Lenny newsletter. with that I bring you Anton OC this episode is brought to you by cinch the customer Communications Cloud here's the thing about Digital customer Communications whether you're sending

Persona has a plan for you learn more at withp persona.com Lenny again that's with P RS o n a.com Lenny Anton thank you so much for being here welcome to the podcast it it's a pleasure to talk to you Lenny great to be here I don't know how you have time to do this podcast your life must be insane these days with the uh the pace at which you guys are scaling just how much is changing in AI every day uh so I just extra appreciate you making time for this I think you said it's 10:30 your time is when we're doing this I'm a bit tired yes mostly from the the crazy pace of everything but yes we're gonna this is gonna be a invigorating conversation you're not gonna be able to sleep I'm sure I'm sure okay so for folks that are maybe a little bit familiar with lovable or not at all familiar what's just what is lovable what's the simplest way to understand it I'd say lovable is your personal AI software engineer you describe an idea and then you get a fully working product


00:06:09 - 00:08:27
that from the and what this means is that entrepreneurs actually today they turn their ideas into real businesses and we have a lot of designers and product managers that uh create the first version of of their product ideas to show to their teams and and some of them become Founders because of like their the empowerment from um but also developers themselves they actually writing code or creating products much faster and um I mean the the reason it's pretty obvious for me so I'll spell it but I'll spell it out the reason why we're doing lovable is that I don't know about your mom but like my mom doesn't write code and my friends almost all my friends from throughout my life reached out for help like Anon I want I do I need to build something how do I find a great software engineer and we're building for this 99% of the population who don't write write code um currently if you're technically inclined you get much further but over time naturally the way to build software is


00:07:18 - 00:09:20
by just talking to an AI That's How is it I love the way you guys describe it and uh you didn't mention but I think it's like building the last piece of software ever how do how do you how do you phrase that yeah we say we say we're building the last piece of software the last piece of software okay we're going to do a live demo but first of all can you just share some stats on the scale of this business at this point because it's quite absurd yeah so we launched lavable less than three months ago and now we have 300,000 monthly active users and 30 of those 30,000 of those are actually uh paying uh and the it is growing on this at the same rates like you you just almost only through organic word of mou okay and uh I'll share a couple stats in terms of Revenue just so folks know this and we'll have this an intro too I think you guys hit four million AR in the first four weeks you hit 10 million AR in the first two months with just 15 people you're the fastest growing


00:08:18 - 00:10:09
startup in all of Europe and you guys had to rewrite your entire code base recently and you couldn't ship any new features for a while is there right that's that's right yeah people were saying like oh you're shipping so fast and we were all quite frustrated because we wrote our service in this you know kind of scripting language and then as we started scaling we we were just now we have to throw everything away and rewrite it in a more performant way okay uh before we get to demo last question you shared there's some companies that have started based on lovable I didn't even know that so what are some examples of companies businesses that have launched off of lovable and now are actually companies I I mentioned the signers using lovable and and one of our early users Harry he he started shipping real web apps to his clients instead of just shipping the signs and then he went on to say okay wait I'm going to start an AI startup and and his he his company he like launched on


00:09:14 - 00:11:21
product hunt and everything and making uh money is just like lets anyone upload their photo libraries and then it's C like Ai pares and C categorizes it and if you go to launched. lovable. apppp like this is an app build Bel lovable which is again a product product hunt version where you can see a lot of businesses or small s featured there okay cool so we're g to come back to some of the stuff but let's get into a let's get into demo I I rarely do demos on this podcast but I'm finding that uh I think it's really important for people to see these products in action because in the large part this is the future of product building and a lot of people hear about oh yeah AI is coming and I don't think a lot of people actually see what the latest tool are capable of and so uh I love showing these sorts of things on this podcast H so Lenny I was thinking um did you ever consider making a copy and build your own adbn this I I haven't but go on how about you do that


00:10:18 - 00:12:34
let's do it let's do it okay so we're gonna make our own Airbnb okay so I I just put in the first prompt for an rbnb clone okay let's look and what what the prompt just to for folks that aren't watching two words rbnb clone that's the pr I like she start INF and then what you get is that the AI says okay I'm going to go through what does a beautiful rbnb clone look like and it goes a bit of like decision design decisions and then I'll zoom out to see more of it h we we have this just UI that is I mean it has all the the nice things you would expect from araban mclone where um you see different categories and you can see two listings fromb with login buttons and everything so far it doesn't have the functionality of rbnb it just has the UI I would now ask for an improvement on some of the functionality like if I'm switching category I want to see different listings let's say but if you if you have any thoughts on what we should build next let me know okay and


00:11:26 - 00:13:45
so you have this pre-loaded so you don't see how long it would take but how long would this normal take for it to just write all this code and have it for you the the first prom takes 30 seconds 30 seconds okay and it's like a very good copy of Airbnb yeah I love that you didn't have to show it to design you just tell it Airbnb and it knows okay so your question is what what I want to add to my own version of Airbnb what I've always wanted to explore buying the place that I look at just like is this for sale so what if we see what that would feel like if you're just like a way to buy buy a listing okay so let's let's how about we add I mean prompting is important here so let's be specific but we would ask um creating a add a button on the listing which say purchase this this Airbnb home is that it perfect so add I've got and I'll be even more specific it will pop up a model um to purchase the listing perfect and I love so I think some things as you're typing I'm just


00:12:36 - 00:15:00
going to share thoughts as you're doing this so the site that you ask this AI engineer to build like it's actually a functioning website you can browse around it's not just a design the say obviously there's no like actual listings here like there's no actual houses here say you were trying to like actually build Airbnb and you wanted to start adding like actual homes that plug into this how does that sort of Step work so as you said this is just kind of the mockup UI but it's Al also interactive if I want to add login and add listing management then we would connect something called The backend so where data is stored where users Lo information is stored and I can show you how how to do that um first let's just try out where we got with this short prompt of adding the adding the purchase uh listing and it it didn't do exactly what I wanted I said uh add um a button or I didn't say what a button should say but it says book now and if I click book now I get uh the a


00:13:47 - 00:15:32
booking confirmation so the the AI was like okay it didn't really it was probably surprised by you wanting to buy the listing since it's rbnb right so it still says book the listing but it's shows a a pretty model where I can click confirm and pay and then it says yeah booking confirmed I'll just say real quick I love that this is actually a really good example of why being a good product manager is important uh a lot of wasted time happens when you're not clear about the problem you're trying to solve and why you're trying to solve it and all that kind of stuff so it's really cool that this is a use case where you have to be really good at explaining what it is you want and it's interesting you don't have to tell this a this aiy you know humans want to understand why is this important uh mostly you need to be very clear about what it is you're doing uh and I love that's a really strong PM skill you know PM's really good at that so we have that


00:14:40 - 00:16:57
explaining exactly what you expect and what you're not getting is even more important with AI than with the humans but um so so I go into hooking up more of the actual functionality but first I'll actually show you something um that like how what's the fastest way to change what went wrong it's it it created uh buttons that say book now and I want them to say um buy now and uh what I could do is Select this item and say change it to buy now but what we just released is that you can actually edit this like this is a fully functioning product but you can edit it visually like you can like you do in square space and Wicks and so on so I'll just change the text to BU now and then it instantly it change just uh it actually changes like deep down in the code base but it's very fast to to do that so I think people listening to this and seeing this if you're not aware like this is The Cutting Edge of tools like this no other tool out there lets you generate code from an AI engineer and


00:15:48 - 00:17:51
then actually just like change a small element of it of every other tool that I'm aware you have to like ask the agent do this for me and then you hope that it does the right thing so this is a huge deal which you just showed right yeah now it says by now that's and that's something that you just launched correct we just launched it a few days ago but uh I want to go into for building the full functionality but what it looks like is that you connect um an open source backend as a service and that's called super base uh and I have this instance to connect to that's completely empty just like one click to set that up and now it's connected to uh the back end it's just like automatically generating and explaining um generating sound code and explaining what I can do next and what I would do now is say let's let's add login let's say let's add login and where is it actually hosted on the back end and everything in general yeah so everything can be one clicked


00:16:50 - 00:18:56
deployed and then it's running it's hosted by like a cloud vendor which is hosting I think a huge chunk of the Internet it's called Cloud flare um and the back end is hosted by the also good cloud provider which is called super based amazing okay uh let's wrap up the demo that was unless there's anything else was there anything else really important you wanted to show no I mean I'll just explain what you what I would do next I would say okay let's add login um let's make the listings editable by the users so users can upload listings and um then this is going to take a bit more time but with patience and um good prompting skills you're going to get to a full working airbn that was a really good uh piece to add so basically like this is getting to a place where it actually is not so different from actual Airbnb uh people can log in they can add their home you can add internal tools to add listings for your say sales team Ops Team basically it just will allow you to


00:17:52 - 00:20:00
build a market place that looks a lot like careb um amazing okay thank you for the demo I think for a lot of people they're like yeah I've seen this kind of stuff for most people like holy it's unreal what like it's almost like we're taking for granted now you can ask a an app to build you a whole website and that cost probably like a few pennies it took like five minutes versus like it would have been tens of thousands in like weeks and weeks and months Even build just a prototype mean these tools as we see here they're already very good like it looks really good as well um but mainly I I would say they getting uh better very very fast and I I'd say like one of the bigger bottlenecks is now they're not integrated into the current way that you have your existing products and so on but since they getting better so fast so fast I think the best thing for people who are interested in this or like interested in just being a part of the future economies get your hands very


00:18:57 - 00:21:06
dirty with these tools because being in the top 10% in using them is going to be to absolutely set you apart in the coming months and years so let's let me follow that thread so say you are magically able to sit next to everybody that is uh using lovable for the first time and you could just whisper a tip in their ear to be successful with lovable what would that tip be it it takes a lot to master using tools like lovable and being very curious and patient and I we have something called chat mode where you can just ask and like to understand like how does this work like is I'm not getting what I'm what I want here um am I missing something what should I do is is is the best way to be productive is also one of the best ways to just learn about how software engineering Works which is you don't have to write the code anymore but it is useful to understand how software or how Building Products works so that so I think that's the patience and curiosity is super useful the second part that we spoke


00:20:01 - 00:21:58
about is that being I would if I Would S sit next to you I would probably say like hey you you're not being super clear here like for example don't say it doesn't work just explain exactly what you're expecting and which parts are working and which parts are not working and that's a lot of that's something that a lot of people don't do naturally I love that like when you have an engineer you're working with that is a very expensive uh mistake to miscommunicate something to just forget about a future to forget about a requirement and here it's you do that and then like 30 seconds later you're like oh okay sorry that was wrong and then you could just try again that's true it might it might be more costly with humans uh okay and the first step so the first tip is chat mode so you could just so your advice is chat with the what do you call it do you call an agent you call what's like the the term for the thing that you were talking with uh yeah lovable is just lovable


00:21:00 - 00:23:09
okay so you're talking about lovable by the way where did you how did you decide on lovable is the name it's so sweet I think it's all about building I mean a great product um that's what I I want more people to be able to do and the best word for a great product is that it's lovable the a lot of jargon that I like to use to like emphasize what we should be striving for is building a minimum lovable product and then building lovable product and they will an absolutely lovable product so I I took that jargon with me in the company name that is great absolute level product Alp the is the new MVP okay so we talked about this the scale you guys have hit at this point I imagine it's far beyond 10 million AR do you share that at this point or you keeping that private we we we don't an on numbers but I I could probably do a twx tweet about this quite soon yes okay so it's far beyond 10 million ER at this point uh it's uh one of the fastest growing startups in


00:22:04 - 00:24:28
history the fastest growing startup in Europe I want to zoom us back to the beginning what is the origin story of loable how did it all begin what was the journey to today I I think I was not impressed by like what people were doing with the large language models when after especially after I was using them way back but when CH gbt came out they were starting to get really good at taking a human instruction and spitting out code and then um people in my team I was the CTO at a YC startup they felt like oh Anon you're exaggerating this is not going to change anything in the coming years so I wanted to prove a point and I created a open source tool called GPT engineer where you you write something like create a snake game and then it spits out a lot of code a lot of different files and then opens the snake game and then I tweeted a video about that and um gbt engineer is today the most popular uh open source tool to showcase the ability for large language models to create applications is that like 50


00:23:16 - 00:25:25
something 50 something thousand GitHub stores and like dozen of academic references and I know that I'll just add that it like GitHub shut you down because I thought it was some kind of attack that like how many stars you getting many people are using it right yeah so that was that that came later that that's with lavable thisable lavable um earlier was always creating new projects on GitHub when someone used lovable and it was we asked them is it fine like how what's the limits here they said oh there no limits but once we started creating 15,000 projects per day uh so there were a lot of usage then some engineer when was on call maybe they woke up in the night and they saw their servers are were taking too much load because of us so then they they shut off down completely and we got this email that said oh you broke some kind of rules and we didn't know what was going on that's some much just story I heard when uh chat GPT was originally being trained Microsoft servers were uh


00:24:21 - 00:26:35
blocked it because they thought it was some crawler and it was just actually like the very first version chat gbt being trained on on data anyway keep going and so I I built this tool called GPT engineer and um I was thinking about I mean we're go we're seeing the biggest change Humanity will ever see I think where like before you had manual labor being taken over by by machines but now it's actually cognitive labor being T being done better than humans by machines and what's the best way to have some kind of positive impact here it's not to make Engineers more productive which is there's a lot of companies using a to make Engineers more productive Microsoft you build co-pilot and so on but it is to enable those who have like such a hard time finding people who are good at creating software that's been their absolute bottleneck and let them take their ideas and their dreams into reality so enabling more entrepreneurship and The Innovation by building the AI software engineer for


00:25:27 - 00:27:32
for anyone and then I I put I grabbed a previous colleague of mine who has also been a Founder Fabian and I said we we should build something like GPT engineer but it it has to be for the people who don't write code that's the story okay and then that became lovable there's like the shift from open source into a product that anyone can use but also pay for makes sense okay so from that point uh I saw stat they started making a million dollars in AR per week and once you launch lavable is that true yeah so we launched um so we actually called the first version of the product like GPT engineer app uh and that that's it was very different in some ways um and we we launched that under a weit list and so like oh yeah we have this weight list and we got a lot of feedback and iterated and finally when we thought the product was really good we said okay now we have a lovable product and it was mainly on the AI that we did a lot of improvements once we launched that that was 21st of


00:26:31 - 00:28:38
November so that's almost three months ago we uh just hit like one mill million AR in a week and then it kept go growing at that that pace it's still growing at even faster than that pace faster than one million AR per week holy okay that sounds like product Market fit to me you said that you did a lot of work on the back in I saw you tweet about this that you guys figured out some kind of unlock on scalability like a new SC scaling law that allowed you to build something like this what can you talk about there that kind of on the technical element allowed you to build something new and and the successful there are many scaling laws I would say when you build AI systems and this one in particular is about when you put in more work this the pro the product reliably gets better and better and what you what you've seen um generally when you have ai building something is that it can get stuck in in some place it stars is super good in the beginning and then it gets stck what we did was to


00:27:34 - 00:29:27
painstakingly identify places where it go stuck and um there there's a different approaches but address like different ways how we do it but address the places where it gets like tuned the entire system quantitatively and having a very fast feedback loop to improve it in the areas where it got stuck the most important areas it still does get stuck sometimes but that's the scale law and um we're still early in that scaling law I would say and so when you talk about things getting stuck it's like the the AI agent just saying like I don't know what to do from this point and or like they introduce some kind of bug is that is that an example of getting stuck introduces some kind of bug and then um it's not smart enough to figure out how to get out of that bug I see and this is a common a common problem people have with tools like this is they like get to a certain point and then it's like well I don't know what to do I'm not an engineer like here's a bug it's running


00:28:31 - 00:30:49
into or the infrastructure is built the wrong way and so it sounds like uh one of the paths to solving that is what you're describing is you make the AI smarter to get to avoid more and more of these places they get stuck another is people just learning how to get AI unstuck uh this something when we had omj on the podcast from replate he said that this is like the main skill that he thinks people need to learn is how to unstuck AI when it runs into a problem uh just thoughts there I don't know anything along those lines come up as I say that me this is something that uh is a problem today and it the frontier of where this is a problem is very rapidly like receding back so uh what we did was we identify the most important areas like oh so specifically adding login creating data persistence adding payment with stripe like those are the things that we made sure it doesn't get stuck on for example um and the places where it gets stuck today um is currently the something that where


00:29:39 - 00:31:33
you can use being very good at understanding and getting unstuck but in the future it won't be so important this is just going to not get stuck and I know you're you're not talking super in depth about this because this is one of your unfair advantages this kind of stuff you figured out so I'm not going to push too far I don't know I know you want not everyone to do exactly the same stuff stuff so I want to zoom back to the pace of growth that you guys have seen one of the big stories everyone's always looking at you guys of like 15 people 10 million AR in two months that's absurd it's something I don't know if it's ever been done in history if if so it's maybe a couple other AI startups recently how have you been able to do this what have you done that has allowed you to grow this fast with so few people I'd like to take credit of like having done everything end to end in the product um but what but we're building on top of the kind of the oil


00:30:36 - 00:32:34
here which we have discovered oil which is are the foundation models right um and then what you what we've done is that we obsessed about what's the right way to present this to a user what's the interface for the human to get as much out of this as possible packaging together I I showed you in the demo that you how you can add authentication and making this work seamlessly together as a whole that that's what we've done and then people love the product that's what that's the driver of the growth uh the for getting awareness we' mainly been posting what we've shipped on social media that's that's how people know about us so building in public is is is how people usually describe that so it's like uh I think it's like you guys have the advantage of the demos are just like holy you can do that and then you guys share the numbers that you guys are growing at so it's innately interesting and sharable uh but I imagine most people have something interesting to share I


00:31:36 - 00:33:49
guess is there anything that you think you did that other companies maybe haven't done that make the product so uh lovable that I mean the the te is everything in building a great product so I I just give a give a big shout out to to te that has written the code I I Haven written the code Rec much of the code recently I would say um and the I mean you you want people who can ship really fast and have have good taste for like what is simple what's the right abstractions and I think that's what we've done differently and have have this Obsession for us making it better and better and better this episode is brought to you by the fundrise flagship fund full disclosure real estate investing is boring prediction markets are exciting meme coins are A Thrill Ride even the stock market can swing wildly on a headline hello deep seek but with real estate investing there's no drama or adrenaline or excuses to refresh your portfolio every few minutes just Bland and boring stuff like diversification


00:32:42 - 00:34:52
and dividends so you won't be surprised to learn that the funrise flagship real estate fund is a complete snoozefest the fund holds $1.1 billion worth of institutional calber real estate managed by team of Pros focused on steadily growing your net worth for decades to come see boring that's the point you can start investing in minutes and with as little as $10 by visiting fund rise.com Lenny carefully consider the investment objectives risks charges and expenses of the fundrise flagship fund before investing find this information and more in the funds perspectus at fundrise.com Flagship this is a paid ad okay I want to come back to the team because I know you have a lot of thoughts there in terms of writing code how much do you guys actually use AI to write the code that is building lovable like how does that work on your team we have set up lovable so that we can change lovable with itself we have done that um since there's a lot of like hyp specific things um in terms of


00:33:46 - 00:35:48
running a separate like we spin up a dedicated computer for each user uh it's doesn't do everything lavable doesn't do everything so we use we like the tools are for developers not for the 99% most of the most of the time and uh everyone uses AI all the time in writing code it's also a great course for experimentations and other tools like cursor and stuff like that like any tools you can sh I think cursor is the um the one that almost every everyone uses in in the team yeah okay cool we I did a survey recently in on tools that my listeners and readers use in cursor like 177% of all people that read my newsletter use cursor already which is absurd and you guys are in there too okay so kind of along these lines there's obviously other competitors and companies in the space so everyone's always wondering uh you bolt repet cursor is a different kind of thing what's the simplest way to understand maybe how Lev B might be different from say bolt and ret which I think are


00:34:48 - 00:37:01
probably the closest the packaging for non-technical people is what we what we aim for and um I showed you in the demo that that you can edit the text like you can change the colors and so on instantly with without having to go into like code editor um and without having to wait this about 30 seconds for the AI to to the full change so uh that's the the big way that we think about packaging it and then for you know making sure that this can be used as productively as possible in a larger team uh something that's different from I think the other other tools is that it's it is synchronized with GitHub and that means that you can use cursor if you're or the people in your team that that want to be more low level they can use cursor and while the people who don't want to mess and set up their local file system and commit to GitHub and so so on they you can use slbl not getting stuck is I I think the most important thing for people and that's why we came we can't enter the


00:35:54 - 00:37:53
space late we haven't done the same type of marketing as many others and we're still um from the people that I talk to ranked as the one that works most reliably I I love it okay so uh so this point about how you can just use lava B to build a lot of it for you and then get into cursor to edit and tweak is is a really big point and you're saying other other companies aren't as good at that yeah I don't know any other dust that oh he W let you do that amazing okay and then what's kind of like the vision for lovable like what's the end state of this is this everybody can build anything they want sort of thing what's the simplest way to understand where you're going in the next I don't know five 10 years I mean I have to say so we're building the last piece of software and it is inherently very hard to predict how the world looks like in five years these days it's very hard and but the last piece of software how I see that is that it's almost instant to go


00:36:54 - 00:39:18
from what you want to change in a product or what you what product you want to build to having it fully working end to end integrated with any of your existing systems or integrated with the kind of the very powerful third party providers already today you can just ask add a chat with open Ai and then you get a chat with open AI in your in your product but um that's like just work working perfectly is the something that's coming in the coming two years I would say um and then after that there is a lot of things in building a product that is not just engineering side right and I think um an AI can be very useful in AGG aggregating and understanding your users so like if you have if you use the analytics tools you know that there's something quite common which is to see how users have interacted with the product AI can do that an absolutely massive scale and propose changes to a human to say like yeah that sounds like a good change to make it a bit more intuitive and it can also automatically run spin out AB tests


00:38:05 - 00:39:59
so that you can see with data all these improvements to the product so that I think that's on the horizon as well quite soon like what's interesting about this in in one way is people wonder just what jobs will be more important what skills will be less important let me share a thought I have and then I want to get your take and see where you go with this it feels like what is getting more valuable as being good at figuring out what to build and then knowing if the thing you had built is correct and good and ready so it's like Discovery ideation uh idea part of the step of launching a product and then it's like taste and and craft just like is this the thing is this going to solve people's problems because the the building now is being done more and more and it's interesting it used to be the reverse engineering was the hardest most valuable skill and now it's like figuring out what to build you could sit there and you you could just tell what to build and a lot of


00:39:03 - 00:41:05
people get to your screen I'm sure and they're like I don't know what to build I don't know what people want and it's like that's the thing now so I just reactions to that and thoughts on what skills will matter more and less I mean if you're if you want to if you're a founder or you want to build something yeah I I totally agree that figuring out what are what are pain pain points and seeing like there are pro often currently solutions to every some kind of solution to everything what is the and how can you make this tenic better somehow like figuring that out is super important when you have um an existing product then I think taste and like refine tasting what is what is good is even more of the important part the tech like the engineer skill set is still going to be important because that that helps you understand what are the constraints so what you can build and I just think a lot of software Engineers are probably a bit scared now like okay am I out of a job what's going to happen


00:40:03 - 00:42:11
but they should see themselves as the people who translate the the problems that are stated by a human probably um to Technical Solutions and but they do have to abstract themselves up a few steps not just like looking at the in their text stack like oh I can just do the front end changes they Engineers or technical people are very good at understanding what are the constraints technically and they should see themselves as that translators is there like a like is it almost like you want to be learn the enge manager skill of overseeing Engineers versus like the actual engineering skill or is you think it's still going to be really important to learn how to code and be really good at that I mean doing a bit of everything being in generalist is I think much more important than it used to be and the if if I'm putting together a product team today I I would re obsess about getting as much of as many skill sets as possible for each person I I hire like they should know how architecting and system works


00:41:07 - 00:43:05
prably they should know design they should know they should have product taste they should know how to talk to users I think everyone should be able to know should know a bit of all of that preferably easier said than done it's hard to find people that know all these things so let's Segway to hiring and how you hire how many people do you have at this point is that some you sure yeah now we're at 18 18 okay wow so I love that you it sounded like you're about to say oh we have 100 people now no 18 okay so you went from 15 to 18 uh okay great so what do you look for when you're hiring people the way saw you describe it on Twitter as you look for cracked Engineers the best cracked team in Europe things like that I guess just specifically what are you looking for when you're hiring I think the most important thing is that people care a lot and they're not just like oh I'm here for a job I'm here for being as as a passenger on this journey but everyone should really care about the product the


00:42:06 - 00:44:19
users and Care a ton about the team how the team works together and that you're always contributing to making the team work more productively together and that like care or preferably Obsession ER gets you very long way and then um you do often want to have like absolute absolute superpower of some Dimension to be able to understand and do as many POS things as possible like have this generalist brain that quickly learns any skills but be super super good in in one dimension and that's for us that's of that's mostly cramming as much out of AI out of the large language models and understanding the um the entire parameter space of what you can change to make this the our product to perform better so how do you actually test for these things you know like some of these things described I think everyone's looking for like they care about the user they want to collaborate well just like when you're because like you have 18 people building in a company that's growing more than a million AR every


00:43:12 - 00:45:15
week like that's an absurd uh uh scale and the people you found are clearly world class and I think a lot of people are going to like want to hire the type of people you're hiring so when you're actually interviewing how do you sus out some of these things like like their AI cramming skills their team building collaboration what do you actually do I ask people what they've done before and they these people that I'm describing they have often done something where they care a lot about what they've done before uh and dig into details about the technical things that they did and then um I mean we do the normal thing of giving it showing a very hard problem that is a bit unorthodox that someone hasn't seen before preferably and see how they think through the think and reason through that I then something that I think is more Uncommon is that we do I pretty much always have people join the work simulation for at least a day often a full week awesome okay so work


00:44:14 - 00:46:19
trial that's awesome so basically they work with the team for at least a day you said like sometimes a week yeah and uh I love this point you made about they show they cared deeply about some they previously worked on and you can you look for just like obsession with the thing that they built last or something they worked on like what percentage are Engineers of these 18 the 12 at least write code in at least part times 12 out 18 okay cool uh you when we were setting up you're like oh our Engineers creating content now I think that's a cool example of of how people do a lot of different things yeah uh also okay so I have your job posting that you shared once of like the actual job description I'm going to read a few lines from it it's uh very inspired by Shackleton right would you agree cool I love it by the way did you write this or did you have ai write this job description where you like create an engineering job description FR let me read it to you I don't even know you may not know


00:45:17 - 00:47:22
whatever you referring to uh I'll read a few lines here long hours High Pace candidates must Thrive under high urgency under AGI timelines approaching uh difficult Mission ahead honor and recognition in case of success those seeking comfortable work need not apply and then there's a few other things collaboration with other exceptional Minds purpose larger than any normal engineering role generous share in the Venture success amazing thank you thoughts yeah so I I did I did get some help with the the formatting of this but then I was mostly me doing the the exact pring of the different sentences so good and I love that you know to some people it's going to be like holy I'm not signing out for this but to a lot of people the people you want is like yes this is exactly what I want to be doing great amazing Okay cool so so it feels like one of the elements of hiring here is uh create a really good filter to be clear about just how intense this is so that the people that want that are


00:46:20 - 00:48:54
the ones drawn to you okay and then you're also you're in Sweden uh fastest growing startup in Europe ever thoughts on building in Europe Sweden versus the US San Francisco yeah so this this ambition level that you you're talking about in the job is more Uncommon in Sweden and I think that is the like the biggest unlock that someone like me who sees that this is the um like the time in human history when you have the most impact per worked hour and and that's why we have to be super ambitious like just up the ambition level and then then we can maybe retire and have ai take care of most most things in society um that and inspiring people to be this ambitious um in a place where the average ambition is lower but the talent the raw talent is um much more available is is a great recipe I think that's a great recipe so the and that's what I think it's some kind of Advantage there it's a bit of a double-edged sword but but it's some kind of Advantage so I'm hearing is like there's there's


00:47:37 - 00:49:42
incredible people in Europe they're just not uh they're harder to find and what I'm hearing is like the key is how do you sus them out and get them to to want to talk to you yeah most people in Europe they haven't thought that oh do going on an extremely ambitious mission is what I want to do so that's that figuring out who those are H is is a big part of it awesome okay I want to talk about priorization I imagine all these things that I just shared about just like how uh ambitious this mission is how much you're doing the last piece of software you must have a bazillion things that people ask you to build that you want to build what's your approach to deciding what to biriz and actually build I ju Just Top Line I think identifying what is the biggest ball neck what the biggest produ problem and iterating fast on saying okay this is the biggest problem let's really really solve that that problem and then picking the next one um and not overthinking not like dreaming out the


00:48:39 - 00:51:01
long road map that's my my default it's a very very simple algorithm um understanding what is the most B the biggest problem is not always a simple simple problem I think yeah so we spend time as one should on talking to users list reading up on what people are writing we we have the F board for where people do a lot of requests as you say and then um when we pick one of the problems we're quite engineering lead like for a product like ours it's hard to be like have uh product managers that are not Engineers say oh this is what we should do now because like the right solution to the problem might be in time Tangled in things that are um like technical details they might be entangled in technical details of like okay yes this is the biggest problem but we should Sol we should have this larger technical initiative that's going to solve all of these problems so it's it's quite engineering lead um compared to many other product companies as it should I'd be I'd be worried if you guys had a


00:49:51 - 00:52:01
product manager at this point makes that would not that wouldn't make no sense right now I imagine the answer is it's chaos and there's no actual uh defined process but just like what does it look like generally like what's kind of the Cadence you guys operate on how do you take an idea to like build it spec it launch it just like what does that look like if you have something if you look back like three months we mainly said okay let's do this weekly planning and we have we have like a fig Jam board where we have all the main problems and then we have kind of rank them which are which on do we focus one more f on next or this week um and then we have a demo where we say like okay this are this the things we Shi this week so they get everyone on the same page and we do have a bit more of a road map now and where we say like here are we going to make so sure you can support custom domains next they're going to add collaboration uh after that and and the like the biggest problem now or the the


00:50:55 - 00:52:59
biggest initiative now that solves the biggest problem is making the system more identic um and that has a bit of a longer road map but we still do the kadence of weekly planning these are the like the things we're focusing on this week it's mostly there's a good word for this that you I would want you help with with Polish fixing the bags and and polish this week and that was the planning on Monday that was actually this week was uh Polish Polish week I love that uh how far is this road map that you're now having I mean it's uh clear over the coming month but it stretches up three months and then but with with in one month it's probably going to look a bit different okay and then what are the tools you use just for folks that want to understand like the latest tools so you said fig Jam what else isn't that stack of tools I mean we do so many things in our company in linear because it's just such amazing product so we we do Talent application tracking in linear oh w


00:51:58 - 00:54:32
after going through and and this seeing a l of the other made custom made tools for that uh linear and then uh feed jum so simple uh how soon until one of your engineers is an agent engineer in AI engineer do you think do you have a sense I love to dig into what what does that question actually mean um I think we've been talking about like oh AI that would require um or something playing chess that's that's AI like if you if an if a computer can play chess that's Ai and now that's like oh no that's a chess program and we always shifting this forward and forward um I think anything that a human doesn't do is just a smart computer system right so what is when is some when is an a software engineer and agent I think it's always going to be just we're building in lovable is just an interface that humans interact with to create the software that they want and then how we solve that is that going to be an agent under some definition yeah sure I think so but uh that's less


00:53:14 - 00:55:10
important to me okay I like that let me ask this you guys are moving super fast scaling like crazy you described a little bit about your process weekly planning uh fig Jam Board of is and now there's a road map that you're kind of thinking out in the future is there anything else that you found was helps you move this fast that gives you a lot of Leverage over the small team you have to ship quickly and move fast that you haven't already mentioned we we work from the office most of the time I think it's it's pretty nice then you can say like hey I think we're thinking wrong about this thing or like shouldn't we actually do this other thing and especially I think lunch like eting lunch together is a pretty productive hour uh where you're cross-pollinating I mean people are constantly thinking subconsciously as well about the how to solve the different problems and which the most important ones are and then being in office um has this like Focus or most of the time you should be Focus


00:54:13 - 00:56:11
but you also have this like high bandwidth where everyone has a bit unstructured communication I love that uh the answer to uh the CEO of a company that's the one of the most advanced AI tools in the world is one of your answers to how to move fast is like lunch together I love that it's so human and so it makes all the sense in the world but I love that that's still a part of this yeah okay you talked about this kind of on the same thread you talked about if you were to start in a team like a new product team today say you were head of product somewhere or head of RPM uh VP of product somewhere building a new product team scaling a product team what would you do going forward that's different from what people have done in the past in terms of who you're hiring how you're structuring them that kind of thing just like what do you think people should be thinking as they build product teams going forward knowing tools like lovable exist and all the other stuff that's


00:55:12 - 00:57:37
going on I mean everyone should be excited about using AI I think that's a pretty big one um and then and the team working really well together is is what like the lunch you have to H like to sit down and solve problems together um you should at the bottleneck for most products these days is not going to be as much on engineering but having good taste good intuition about your users and um that I mean engineers and everyone preferably in the team should have that like willingness at least to to want to go through that motion and listen to the users um and truly understand what what they care about what's kind of like the background of most of the engineers and people you've hired are they like is there anything like in common are they just like super uh impressive humans generally like you know champions of programming contest stuff like that I don't know like what are some attributes of the folks you've hired so far I think Ro cognitive capability is the strongest


00:56:24 - 00:58:32
like di the the strongest correlate of being at love lovable but there there is this startup mindset that I I think is also very strong being a bit more being being much more interested in moving very fast and uh iterating fast than having like a lot of structure a lot of process and thinking about the business as a whole more than thinking about my specific profession my specific craft that I'm see myself like wanting to dig in into on me amazing okay so smart like very smart entrepreneurial acts like an owner yeah doesn't just uh isn't just like this isn't just a job but they feel like they actually have agency okay this is great there's something you said kind of along these lines that uh I think is important that one of the things that gets you excited about what you're building is giving people superpowers and especially people that don't out a code basically 99% of people is there anything along those lines that you think is important to share it's very


00:57:28 - 00:59:51
clear to most people who have been Engineers or been Founders that the um there's so many that have failed in their Endeavors because they didn't have someone that know how to solve the technical parts and now that we're close to having people know that this was like know that this was exist and they work they solve everything uh it's going to be an gri an explosion of like entrepreneurship and better software product we're not going to settle for all the annoying bad technology that we that we use today and um everyone uh who has an idea is going to say like okay I'm gonna build this thing and show you that this is the best this is the best version of the product or what our company should be doing instead of having long meetings or like writing up documents so it's um going to be empowering across a lot of different professions and and places in the world what's what's next for lovable what's kind of like the next few things they might launch as this episode comes out I


00:58:39 - 01:00:55
mentioned this agentic behavior and when I say agentic what it means is that the you give more freedom to the system to decide what what happens next it might want to write a test run those tests and see like oh the tests fail let let's fix those so so that's um one the big unlocks for getting further faster and on then there's some more like obvious things that you want to do to go all the way to easily go all the way to making money with lovable and that's that's like how do you set up so that it's hosted on your specific domain how do you collaborate seamlessly with your team H and making that that easier so that are just obvious things um and something we're thinking about is to help the founders succeed after they built their first version and like how do they get more users how do they get feedback how do they get the word out if they buil something useful I was just gonna say that that that's that's exactly where my mind went is like everyone's gonna be building all


00:59:47 - 01:01:28
these things no one's ever gonna get any traction with these tools because no one knows how to find users get anyone to basically go to market and growth is like a whole different skill so that is so cool that you're thinking about that how do we run some paid ads for you how do we think about SEO how do we think about Word of Mouth reality referrals that is very cool okay yeah we already have some playbooks that we that we help the people building with like how how do you do those things that you can find up on a Blog oh interestingly this makes me want to buy some meta stock because all these apps that everyone's building they're gonna all be running paid ads on Facebook and Google oh my God what a good business those other guys got uh I want to come back to you said that you can work on your existing code base this actually a big question for a lot of people they see all these tools they're all like amazing for prototypes and concepting you talked about how you can


01:00:38 - 01:02:37
actually do this within your existing codebase use lovable let me correct you there you cannot use it on any con existing codebase got it um we kind of have a research preview of of importing your codebase but what you can do is if you start in lovable then you can have engineer is editing it how in whatever tool they want to use for editing it okay cool that's great clarification so I guess just for people because a lot of like most list here are not building something brand new they're working within an existing product so you're saying that that is coming you can use lovable in the future in some form with your existing app and product great wow that's huge okay because that's basically the most most people so that's going to be a big deal okay uh final question we have the segment on this podcast called failure Corner okay where most people come this podcast they show all these stories of success and everything's going great and here's all the things always winning you guys this


01:01:37 - 01:04:11
is a good example just up and to the right the fastest growing product ever uh what's an example when something totally failed in the course of your career and and what did you learn from that I I'm withit hard pressed to find something that totally failed but I think there's a bit of a product lesson um where I was the first employee at an AI startup here in stockolm called sonal labs and the premise was just okay so humans learn in different ways you if you personalize then you get two standard deviations more uh effective learning so there there are a lot of products like education software that helps you learn um that is not personalized and we could build we were building an API personalized learning uh and the I mean the AI and so was it was pretty good but the thing that we were doing in the end was to say like okay here's this product here someone has build a product or some some way to learn where be it like English thing du lingo and then that the people that have that product have to


01:02:54 - 01:04:59
use this Advanced AI API to start to making it personalized and it was it's a very hard like retrofitting like oh you have to switch out the engine and put in this Ai and it it's the big learning here is it didn't work very well on for the company I mean the company wasn't super successful in this the big learning is that you have to start with like how is this product working end to end and then add AI or think where should we add AI so that was big learning for me that um you you really want to see like like how the what is the big picture of the user what's the big picture of how this should how do you think the user experience should be and then add something with AI uh to solve specific problems and now now Sons is doing great but it's it's not on top of that product specifically that's I think it's a lot of people hear this and they're like of course but I think it's so hard to actually remember this point when you have cool Tack and you're like holy


01:03:57 - 01:06:07
everyone needs to try this they're going to love it and then you don't realize like no one actually cares if it's not solving a problem for them you know there's like a lot of novelty products that like everyone want to use for a little bit and then like forget and it's not I don't actually need this often and so I like what this makes me think about is there's all these product lessons for what is likely to help your product be successful and an app like like a tool like lovable can help you do this because because if someone is building something you can guide them okay what's the problem you're solving for somebody how many people have this problem how much does this matter to them maybe we should add like the Lenny mode it activates in lavable activates like this product product coach questions you wait hold on are you this why let's take a step back everyone's G be like out of my way yeah exactly what's your yeah what's your experiment plan uh that's actually I


01:05:02 - 01:07:05
think there's actually a big opportunity there to say people because you know there's like a play around with this thing and then there's like okay but really is this anything people actually want can we call it Lenny mode is that a fine with you 100% awesome let's do it I'll license you no cost sure okay okay we made a deal here let's do it okay uh Anton is there anything else that you wanted to share anything you want to leave listeners with uh before I let you go and go to sleep I think again the the world is changing quickly and it's very fun you should see that's like have fun in all all of this change um and the best thing you can do for your current profession or if you want to have a new job is to be in the top 1% in knowing how to use the AI tools so go out there use use lovable use other a tools and become um make sure to understand or try to understand as much as possible and how to use them productively um that that's that's something I I tell all my friends in


01:06:03 - 01:07:59
jally and I I like love the audience to know as well okay well I gotta make try to make this even more specific for people uh how do you know if you're in the top 1% like what's like a heuristic almost of like slash how do you get there is it just use it a 100 times a day what else what can you recommend yeah I I think if you spend a full week on trying to reach an outcome the best way to learn is like I want to do this thing and then I want to use AI to do that thing uh and you've spent a full week you're you're in the top one% in the global population if you have friends that you surround yourself with friends who who have this Obsession or they also care a lot about this uh then you'll be quickly in the top 0.1% so what I'm hearing is like find a problem that that need that can be solved like find a problem a pain point for yourself or someone yeah and then end to end like fully solve that problem spend a week getting from idea to like a thing that was actually somebody's


01:07:01 - 01:09:11
actually using yeah and you're in the top one% yeah I I think at the top yeah the top one% by just spending a a full week and making like asking AI if you don't understand so make making sure that you understand yeah like that's the thing people forget you just ask like like you would would you ask the chat feature of lovable in this case or would you go to cloud or chat GPT to ask for advice I mean my recommendation here if you're in product is to use lavable to build software and and learn that AI tool if you're and then you should use chat mode and chat mode I have to add is something you activate in your user profile it's not launch like in the in the main product so it's in in in Labs but if you add that flag then you can use chat mod if you're if you want to learn some other AI tool then you should I mean ask that tool or ask Claude B about how how how that topic that domain works okay amazing uh where can people find you where they where can they find


01:08:07 - 01:10:22
lovable and how can listeners be useful to you lovable posts updates and me on lovable Dev on Twitter and we post things on LinkedIn as well and there a lot of lot of things coming out and changing in how we will software so you can follow lovable Dev and you can follow me at Anon OA at Twitter um I'd love more feedback on what people like where people see this is huge change for them and we there lot a lot of people posting about that on Twitter but there we have a Discord where you can share like oh this is how I use loveable it was super useful to me um and H feedback. lovable dodev you can give you can ask for uh new features there's a lot of people asking enough boting what features you want next so and that's useful that's the most important thing for us we just want to solve people's problems amazing Anon you're doing incredible work what a what a journey uh I'm excited to have you back someday when we see more chapters of this journey to as do we all that's why
