    "insight_density": "Mix of solid tactical advice with some genuinely useful specifics, but nothing that fundamentally changes how you think about AI or product management. About 1 decent insight per 10 minutes.",
    "signal_to_noise": "Well-edited with clear demos and minimal rambling. Host keeps things moving and guest stays focused on practical examples.",
    "actionability": "Very strong - provides step-by-step workflows, specific prompts, and replicable processes. You could implement most of these Monday morning.",
    "contrarian_index": "Mostly consensus views about AI being helpful for PMs. Nothing particularly controversial or challenging to conventional wisdom.",
    "freshness": "Uses current AI tools and references recent developments, but the core insights about workflow optimization are somewhat timeless. Could stay relevant for 1-2 years.",
    "host_quality": "Good at extracting specific examples and keeping guest focused on practical demos rather than theory. Asks follow-up questions and manages the technical demo well."
