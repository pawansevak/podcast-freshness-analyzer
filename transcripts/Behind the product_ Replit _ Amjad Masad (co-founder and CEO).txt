00:00:00 - 00:02:04
the idea behind repet is that making software today is very difficult we want to make it easier people view this as a developer in their pocket essentially we have 34 million uh users globally there's people everywhere learning to code and RL building startups building personal software personal tools for people building products they product managers Founders like what skills do you see will matter more matter less typically you're bottlenecked where your ideas are not fitting in because like they need to be made and they need to be made quickly now you open up that bot like so now like actually making things is is a lot easier actually you become limited by how fast you can generate ideas I think people are unaware of just how far things have gone I could imagine whatever 5 years from now someone running a billion dollar company with zero employees where it's like the support is handled by AI the development is handled by Ai and you're just building and creating this thing man the


00:01:02 - 00:02:50
future is wild today my guest is amjad mad amjad is the co-founder of repet an AI powered software development and deployment platform for building and shipping software it's one of the fastest growing developer communities and AI products in the world there's a lot of talk these days about how AI is changing how products will be built how product teams are going to operate which functions will be more and less valuable over time but I feel like very few people have actually seen what modern AI tools can do and have fully grasped how much you can get done with very little technical skill now and in the future and so I'm going to do an experiment with this podcast where I'm going to do a series of behind the product episodes where we go deep on important products that product Builders should be aware of and should probably start playing with in our conversation omj does a demo of what you can do with repc today which is going to blow your mind and then we spend most of the


00:02:02 - 00:03:58
conversation talking about the implications of this on the future of product development on the future of product management and on the future of startups and Founders it's a very exciting time it's also a very scary and destabilizing time for a lot of people and my thinking is the more you are aware of what's possible today and where things are going the better position you'll be in to thrive in this very wild and crazy future that is coming very fast if you enjoy this podcast don't forget to subscribe and followed in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube it's the best way to avoid missing future episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously with that I bring you amjad mad amjad thank you so much for being here welcome to the podcast uh it's my pleasure I thought it'd be great to start with just having you explain what is repet what's the vision where is this going what job does it do for people the idea behind repet is that uh making software today is is is very difficult


00:03:02 - 00:05:22
and uh we want to make it easier uh one of the reasons for the difficulty is that uh it is very fragmented so you would need to download an what's called an IDE it's basically a code editor you need to download the runtime basically python or JavaScript need to figure out a package manager to configure your kind of Open Source packages and once you've done all of that you need to figure out how to deploy it how to share it how to and so it's it's a very hard process and that's one of the ways uh where people get stuck and never learn how to code because it just feels like this cumbersome it process and so the vision uh for ret has always been is like okay making software is fun is great more people should do it but uh so for more people to do it it needs to be um easier to do it needs to be in one place and it needs to be learnable it's easy to learn and so so that's the product today it is I think one of the more easier um idees environment deployment environment uh on on the internet and uh


00:04:13 - 00:06:17
and I think we make it really easy for people to just jump in even without prior experience of coding especially now with the new AI products that we built this episode is brought to you by work OS if you're building a SAS app at some point your customers will start asking for Enterprise features like samle authentication and skim provisioning that's where work OS comes in making it fast and painless to add Enterprise features to your app their apis are easy to understand so that you can ship quickly and get back to building other features today hundreds of companies are already powered by work OS including ones you probably know like versel webflow and Loom work OS also recently acquired warrant the fine grain authorization service warrant's product is based B on a groundbreaking authorization system called Zanzibar which was originally designed for Google to power Google Docs and YouTube this enables fast authorization checks at enormous scale while maintaining a flexible model that can be adapted to


00:05:14 - 00:07:22
even the most complex use cases if you're currently looking to build role-based access control or other Enterprise features like single sign on skim or user management you should consider work OS it's a drop-in replacement for off zero and supports up to 1 million monthly active users for free check it out at work.com to learn more that's [Music] work.com this episode is brought to you by Persona the adaptable identity platform that helps businesses fight fraud meet compliance requirements and build trust while you're listening to this right now how do you know that you're really listening to me Lenny these days it's easier than ever for frauders to steal pii faces and identities that's where Persona comes in Persona helps leading companies like LinkedIn Etsy and twilio securely verify individuals and businesses across the world what sets Persona part is its configurability every company has different needs depending on its industry use cases risk tolerance and

user demographics that's why Persona offers flexible building blocks that allow you to build tailored collection and verification flows that maximize conversion while minimizing risk Plus persona's or registration tools automate your identity process so that you can fight rapidly shifting fraud and meet new waves of Regulation whether you're a startup or an Enterprise business Persona has a plan for you learn more at withp persona.com Lenny again that's with p r n.com Lenny what's the scale of reel at this point how large is has gotten how many people are using it we have 34 million uh users globally we have a large uh Global presence there's um you know people everywhere learning to code on rlad building startups um you know building personal software personal tools or internal tools of companies more recently we've been uh expanding to companies we released our kind of B2B package in in July and that's been growing really fast it's been really fun


00:07:23 - 00:09:18
to see people bring repet to work as well damn I knew it was popular I didn't realize it was that large actually um as I Was preparing for this podcast episode there's this tweet that kind of that went viral where this guy Jin who I actually know I know this guy from Canada he's awesome tweeted about how his 11-year-old girl built an app uh in repet she just like had an idea and she built it and the best part of it is someone in the like replied to him and they're like like you have to to like launch an app you have to like host it somewhere you have to build a database you have to like deploy it there's no way to that and he's like no that's exactly what rep did yeah that's what we do that everything that that that commenter was talking about and he's right right like it's it's the the surprising thing about an 11year old building an app is not so much even the coding it is like all the nonsense around it and so we just we just abstract all that away I love that and


00:08:21 - 00:10:10
that's I struggled with that myself when I was an engineer way back in the day oh you were an engineer I didn't know that I was I was an engineer for 10 years I was an engineering manager and then jump ship into product and wow I'm happy I did but I do miss that I was I was not an amazing engineer I was like a good enough startup engineer so this is the kind of stuff that I would have love to use so we're going to jump into a demo of what this actually looks like I thought maybe actually before we get into it there's other tools that people are aware of that help you build stuff and so to kind of put a finer point on like what this does and how it's different from other things you may have heard of say cursor comes up a lot these days just talk about like a little bit about the competitive landscape of who else is out there that helps you build product well again we go go back to this idea of like endtoend platform for making software so that's like from writing code all the way to deploying it


00:09:14 - 00:11:26
and uh and monetizing it and all of that uh now every step in the process of the software development life cycle there are a lot of different tools so cursor is a fork of vs code that's made um that has really awesome AI tools but that's an editor you still need a runtime you still need a deployment environment actually quite a few users use use cursor in tandem with repet because repet just simplifies the runtime and deployment environment and so you have products uh you know AI products uh different uh places in the software development life cycle uh but really what differentiates repet is that we we do everything but but also uh you know that makes it hard hard to adopt for for certain people like if you're at a big company it's very easy to bring a new editor uh and start coding with it it's quite hard to build to to bring you know something that's quite opinionated about about everything uh from the from how the code runs to how the code deploys but that's a trade-off we're willing to


00:10:21 - 00:12:15
make it's like yeah we're not going to get into uh into the Enterprise you know main software development pipeline but we want to Empower everyone to to be able to build software and that means product managers designers we we have you know operations people sales Ops HR Ops we have lawyers uh uh using using repet and so it is it is democratizing the AC of software uh software engineering amazing and that's why you're here let's do a demo while you're pulling it up you're going to share your screen and show us what this product can do and the reason I I'm excited about doing a demo and this is an experiment kind of a new type of podcast episode I'm doing where we're diving into specific products and what they can do I feel like there's so much talk about Ai and what it's doing and people keep reading about oh a I can do this and AI can do that and I feel like not many people actually like see this stuff in action especially the most Cutting Edge


00:11:17 - 00:13:24
stuff like I think people are unaware of just how far things have gone and how much is actually possible especially when someone that knows what they're doing is using the product so I'm excited to show people what is actually possible and especially because this is going to impact the future of product management and product teams so I'll turn it over to you give us a demo awesome so this is uh reet's uh homepage you can create what's called a Repel which is a project uh we have all sorts of languages you can you can pick from uh really in the hundreds but most recently and this is how repler became like a thousand times easier is you can just describe what you want to make so you go to this homepage we have this text box and you can you can write something like uh make me a cool app uh or what have you but uh you know a more descriptive prompt is is better and so uh I asked uh RPM at repet Aman mathur who's a who's a fan of the show to to tell me what PMS like to


00:12:21 - 00:14:21
build and so he came up with a prompt he kind of uh really crafted a great prompt so I'm G to put it here uh and basically what he what we're asking for is we want to build a web application you can you can say what stack you want to use or you can leave it up to the AI to decide here we're saying you know build it in nodejs for product managers to track feature requests on a public dashboard so say you know I have a product I'm growing I have a community I want that Community to engage with building the product I want them to M feature requests vote on them I want to be able to manage that so we're talking here about the feature of voting system future requests read a few of them just for folks that aren't watching on YouTube to give them a sense some of this some of the stuff in this prompt so so feature request submission so allowing the users to add features up voting system so allowing users to upo these uh features feature requests and Status tracking being able to uh it's


00:13:21 - 00:15:31
like a can band style board with columns like planned and progress so that way the admin can can kind of share with the community what they're building and we want it to be userfriendly design so make it modern and all that nice kind of prompty things and then uh admin controls for product manager so you know as a product manager I want to be able to kind of really manage this this community it builds internal tools too not just the front exactly exactly all right so we're gonna start building uh since this is like a pretty big big prompt uh the the the initial coding might might take a while there's different styles of using graet agent uh I often go with like minim minimalist prompts that's also how I code as well uh like I have like a vague idea of what what I want to build and Eder it from there other people you know product managers like to like write prds and and like more descriptive things and you can do either of those things the AI now responded and said you know U you


00:14:26 - 00:16:38
know I'll build all of that for you I'm going to build up the initial prototype and you can tell me how it feels and then we can make it better from there thei is also suggesting adding common threads implementing email notifications and so I can select those and you know it's being creative it's telling me what else I could build but for now I'm just going to go with a prototype and then we can assess from there so as you see as the Prototype is starting you can see this progress pane where we can watch the AI doing its thing so here it's created postris database obviously when we're building a full stack application you to be able to save things uh so this is one of the cool things about repet we have all these Services storage database so now it's coding it's building the database schema uh now it's building the um the home homepage and it's actually quite fun and edifying to watch watch it build us because you can uh you can really start to learn how to structure web apps


00:15:31 - 00:17:33
and you know if uh it runs into a problem and you know as things get complicated it might run into into a problem and you want to be able to like help debug and things like that it's good to be to be able to have an idea of what's going on but it's not necessary I think a lot of people just don't don't care about the code and are still able to to build things but we want to make the process transparent you want to show people exactly what the agent is doing like you're basically sitting there behind an engineer on a computer and just watching them code is what this feels like yeah and and actually the way we built it is is like it's a multiplayer system so repet is um you know has real time what we call multiplayer coding and uh we reused this the multiplayer system to build the agent so the agent in the code is structured as a another user of the platform so basically we're both coding together together so I can go into the files here and that's the thing that makes repet


00:16:33 - 00:18:51
really cool I think people are familiar with some of the more like chat interfaces uh like vzero and others where it's purely chat but this is like a full IDE where you can like go and look at the files and and edit them yourself or ask ask the AI for an explanation what's kind of the limitation of what this can do today like what can't you do say you're like you have zero coding experience what sorts of products can you not yet build with something like this that might be possible in the future how far does this take you now you know you can build uh MVPs I think you can also start to get some some initial users I think when it's when you start iterating on the the product like large iterations you might run into problems for example you know it's not very good at data database migrations and so we're trying to fix that so you know a lot of when you're iterating on the product a lot of the times you're actually um you know changing the um the structure of the app and that that


00:17:41 - 00:19:39
requires database migrations and so now like it might change the database in a way that creates an error that's unrecoverable uh and at that point it you might you might get stuck especially if you don't know how to code uh some people will figure it out by going going to Chad GPD and Claud and like asking questions and and like I I actually I'm really inspired about how persistent some of our users are which is really amazing but I think yeah that's like you'll get an MVP past the MVP where it's like a product that's working and you need to change and iterate on it it's it's a it's still a struggle now but I expect you know over the next few months we'll we'll continue it's like if you think about it it's like sort of we're building uh you know we're building as you building so we're building out the agent so that it can continue uh getting better um as our users are also uh building their applications got it so what I'm hearing


00:18:41 - 00:21:07
is it's really good at building like the first version and helping you get to something that you can even have people use it's not amazing yet evolving from there like using AI to help you make the product better and better and better and iterate yes but you can get in there if you have if you know how to code and take from there right yes or you can hire someone um we have a feature on the site called bounties where you can hire human coders to kind of help you finish finish finish that's gonna be the our job for humans for like that'll remain for a while you know what we want to do we we want to get to a point where uh the agent can go grab a uh human when it into a problem I think I think that would be that would be sick oh my God it's like everything's reversed I love it oh look I think it might be done check that out yeah so so now um the agent is asking us is the application running and showing the homepage I like like confirming like so yeah almost asking us to do a QA I'll just say Yes


00:19:53 - 00:22:01
uh so it found an error so there's an error here and it's like uh there's a warning I'm going to fix it so in the meantime as it's fixing it so you know it can be proactive right because it you know looks at all the errors and things like that but in the meantime we can use it I just um created an account oh it's it's coding okay it's fixing the that's cool yeah restart okay well we'll wait for it how long would you say it would take an engineer to build this like a you know like a typical engineer a few days I would say to a week um I mean if if you're really good at it might be hours but um but you know it probably would take me a few days I would say I'm a I'm like a decent engineer it'll take it'll take me a few days yeah it took how much like five 10 minutes yeah um and probably like costes you know cost us something in the in the sense wow in terms of compute yeah in terms of compute yeah um like probably you know I would estimate it at like 15


00:20:57 - 00:22:59
cents or something like that wow okay so here it is here it is and and the agent was like okay this this is looking good completed it if you want to deploy deployed but I'm like okay I'm gonna test it first um and so currently it's living just locally on your Local Host yeah it's not it's yeah it's not Local Host it's some rlo but but yes it's it's the equivalent of Local Host yes uh because it's really easy I can even invite you to this session and you I can you can be here with me and so it's it's all online got it so let's admit a feature so um make the product uh prettier that's what a typical user might say so we we have this here you can you can upload it I guess I don't I can't upload it because I'm the user that created it but created another user you can you can upload it but now you know we need to be able to move things around right uh as the admin so I don't know how to log into the admin panel so I'm going to ask the agent uh how do I


00:21:58 - 00:23:47
log to the admin panel so it might have already built the feature and it's it's not exposed in the right way it'll it'll be able to what I love about just like watching you interact with this thing and just real quick I'll throw out it feels like an engineer like that is behind the scenes building this thing like on slack and you're just talking to them they built this thing they're like I'm check this out I'm done and you're like oh okay but how do I log into this admin panel and they're like okay here we go yeah so it says uh it says uh you know it's gonna would you like me to help you register account so it's it's creating an account an admin account for me so it's it's it not only um you builds things it's also um it also maintains things right so in this case it's it's actually doing SQL queries it's not writing code to create a to create an admin account for us it's insane I want to talk about the


00:22:53 - 00:24:56
implications of this on product development and product management and Founders but just a like what we just witnessed is somebody I know you do have technical abilities but someone that didn't have to didn't have to have any technical skill build like a real product that people can use like in five minutes that looks good and works and you could keep making it better by talking to this agent well I'll tell you from from our experience like what we're seeing uh like you know there's so many products that are empowering developers like it's a very easy calculation to say we're going to make Engineers 20% better um and we're going to like sell it to companies and we're g to you know take 10% of that value right like that's why there's so many startups now that are just trying to make Engineers a little better our our calculation is like well you know what if you made everyone developer like what what does that what does that look like and so when we released agent and really made


00:23:54 - 00:26:08
programming a lot easier what we're seeing is that people exactly like like you said people view this as a developer in their pocket essentially um what we're hearing from customers is that I'm doing things I would otherwise have to go hire a developer but also because the activation energy is is lower than going to hire developer whether upor or other places I'm building a lot more ideas that otherwise I wouldn't have built so you know it is I think it was it called the javelins Paradox or something like that which is like when the cost of things go down uh the total consumption of it goes up which I'm not sure why they call it a paradox but like um you know the uh cost of electricity goes down um maybe you would expect that you know the spend the total spend goes down but actually total spend goes up because people consume more of it and so I think that's going to be the case of software like as the costs go down people will just like make a lot more soft software to improve their lives and


00:25:01 - 00:26:50
to improve their work and and start more startups and all of that so to follow that the red what are you seeing inside of startups or even big companies in terms of how folks are already using this knowing this is this is like the worst it will be and it will only become smarter and better right these days what have you what how are people actually using this say that are say product managers or just like non-technical people within startups or bigger companies on the SMB side of things a lot of people people are building kind of back office uh tools right so we have real estate agents that you know have a lot of data have a lot of um things they they want to manage in their business so they're building a lot of these these tools that they otherwise would have to buy but typically when you buy it's it's actually not exactly what you need and that's kind of the problem with SAS it's like it's it's like on siiz fits all and so a lot of people are seeing it as sort


00:25:55 - 00:28:18
of a SAS replacement for in-house tools and and and things like that and and then when you go to the like bigger companies um it's anywhere from from prototyping to to to to actually production apps uh to to tools as well so um we've seen uh product managers build like I said like a V1 of an app and actually go out and test it with users uh and I can't name the company but uh you know I it's a you know there's a company that that have used replit to test a V1 of a of of an app um and obviously after after that set of Works they they take it to the engineers and they're like okay we built this thing we think it's a we think it's a great thing we test it with some users uh let's go actually put it on the road map and and build it build it into the actual product so you are sort of unblocking product Managers from having to need Engineers for every everything that they want to build so they can really build the v0 or V1 of the product uh and and and that's super empowering


00:27:07 - 00:29:32
uh for them we we we saw it also with like marketing departments like spot Hero has a uh marketing a head of marketing that actually can code decently well and but use repet to to BU build as apps and they built like a competitive analysis application that looks at um competitors pricing and make sure that they are you benchmarked uh correctly uh and so it's it's a full stack app use database and everything and it runs in a continuous fashion and we see um sales Engineers um uh you use ret to spin up prototypes really quickly so actually someone at at X formerly uh Twitter uh uh is on the sort of uh partner engineering uh side of things and he uses repet agent to spin up uh applications and prototypes for for customers to see how they can use the a API I love this I love these examples uh by the way the demo is there anything else you want to share about the demo before we close that out so it created an admin account um we can ask it with the username password and and and kind


00:28:19 - 00:30:13
of go into it and and manage it but basically that's it you know it's um the the app is complete in terms of what we asked for uh we can like send it out I can give you a URL we can let's actually just deploy it really quickly just to show people how maybe in the show notes we'll link to the app you could check it out sounds good okay cool that's amazing so this is deploying it onto some like cloud provider I don't know what you use but we use Google Cloud but we we we abstract we abstract all of that away from you but but but we use Google Cloud behind the scenes imagine a place where you can find all your potential customers and get your message in front of them in a cost efficient way if you're a B2B business that place exists and it's called LinkedIn LinkedIn ads allows you to build the right relationships Drive results and reach your customers in a respectful environment two of my portfolio companies webflow and census are LinkedIn success stories census had


00:29:17 - 00:31:19
a 10x increase in Pipeline with the LinkedIn startup team for webflow after ramping up on LinkedIn and Q4 they had the highest marketing Source Revenue quarter to date with LinkedIn ads you'll have direct access access to and can build relationships with decision makers including 950 million members 180 million senior execs and over 10 million SE level Executives you'll be able to drive results with targeting and measurement tools built specifically for B2B in Tech LinkedIn generated a 2 to 5x higher return on ad spend than any other social media platforms audiences on LinkedIn have two times the buying power of the average web audience and you'll work with a partner who respects the B2B world you operate in make B2B be marketing everything it can be and get $100 credit on your next campaign just go to linkedin.com slod Lenny to claim your credit that's linkedin.com pod Lenny terms and conditions apply let's go down this thread actually while this is happening just like what


00:30:18 - 00:32:37
what allows for this to be possible technology- wise like what is the kind of the stack whatever you can share that enables this to exist that yeah for sure first of all is uh it's the all the abstractions that we built so uh the way repet works is um you know the you very bottom layer it's um our runtime so this is the operating system this is the package manager this is the language run times uh we built a system that uh is able to install packages in any language including native packages so the AI anytime um it needs it needs a package I can I can go here and show one of those by the way the AI can take screenshots as well so that it checks it to work so here uh you can see it's it's taking screenshots to make sure the the homepage is rendering here you can see uh you know uh oh it wanted to drag and drop library and so it installed uh installed that and so it has access to all all the packages across all languages including Linux and and all of that and then the layer on top of that


00:31:28 - 00:33:45
is the editor and the infrastructure that runs the editor including what I described as the multiplier editor and then we expose all of that infrastructure to the AI and um there's like almost like a new discipline um called um AI computer interfaces so sort of like HCI is now a ACI and turns out like llms need interfaces that that are actually quite different than than humans uh they're trying to make them use human interfaces like anthropics computer use but those are really expensive and you need to kind of process all this images and video so instead we you know for the shell for example we give it a you know a a sort of a text representation of what the shell is doing at a certain increments um for for package installation we give it we give it a certain tool for editing we give it a like a like an editor tool that like when it's writing the code it's getting feedback on whether they errors or not similar to what a human sees but it's actually like old text just to make it easier so


00:32:36 - 00:35:01
that's uh AI computer interface and obviously all of that sitting on on Foundation Foundation models so the the Improvement in in Foundation models uh has has allowed it allowed us to to to build this the the you know uh the most important model that we use is the sonnet uh model from from uh Claude uh from anthropic and um it is the best model at at coding so that's the model we use for coding but we use models from uh open AI as well because it's a multi-agent system and so we have models that are uh you know critiquing we have manager editor model and we have like critique model and different models will have uh different uh Powers we also train some of our models like the embedding model for for search uh is something we we train internally so you know I actually wrote about it back in like 22 uh I said it's going to be Society of models like products will be made of a lot of different models and you know it's a quite a heavy engineering engineering project to say the least uh


00:33:49 - 00:35:47
we were talking offline and you said you've been working on this since 2009 when you first built the first idea of repet is that right yes yes God here's the deployed app uh I can I can send it to you and you can use it you can you can see my my my requests even on the logged out page so I can register upload it and log in as admin and move things around we can see what's in progress what's completed like this looks like a product I could see designers spending like days you know designing yeah passing it to engineering PM's you know having feedback Engineers taking a few days to build it yes and here is just a prompt here's what I want that's right that's right and we can iterate on it very easily we can also iterate on the UI we can we can say you know I don't like this or that and it'll it'll do do a good job so we can go here we can start a new session or like a new session to create an entirely new feature here and it'll it'll just do the right thing and


00:34:48 - 00:36:55
it builds from that code base it understands here's what you've built I want to add this thing yes okay and that becomes that becomes your sort of your history right like this was the V1 and now I'm working on this new feature uh and you know and and you know it's almost like what Engineers do in git commit messages by the way it generates get commit messages for every for everything that it does so you can roll back as well and and so we're trying to like make it so that yes it's it's for everyone but we're trying not to abstract too much way we want to build tools right for you to learn to use and so we want Power users to be able to understand the full power of of of ret and it's really deep product I think you can spend you can spend a couple of years to to kind of Master it I want to talk about implications but I want to come back to something you mentioned that uh is incredible that people may have missed you basically built a computer specifically designed for the


00:35:51 - 00:38:09
AI agent to use that is a different version of a computer specifically optimized for how AI wants to use the computer yeah yeah yeah so um uh you know there's an entire discipline uh called like HCI right like it's like computer interaction yeah so so now there are papers about AI computer uh interfaces and interactions um and and and so you know large language models are trained on large tax Corpus from the internet but they're still like kind of alien creatures so they're not like humans so they they have different behaviors and like it's unclear like what's the best way to give it an editor uh so there's so many experimentation about like what's the best way to give it a view on what's editing how many files can you show it like you know uh before it starts to hallucinate and and right now it's like more of an art than science but it's becoming more and more like a science this is insane so it's simple way to think about it there's this foundational


00:37:00 - 00:39:12
model here's what I want you to build and here's a computer to use to build it yes am I yeah here's a computer with a set of tools uh here's a tool to install a package here's a tool to to edit the the code here's the tool to run a SQL query and also Services here's a bunch of services you can graph from here's a database service here's an object store service here's an off service um so you think about it as bunch of external Services the computer with a with a bunch of tools and and and they're all interfacing with the with the foundation model it's funny listening to this how it starts to feel like uh the fact that we might be living in a simulation is not as far-fetched as it may feel like this is feels like the beginnings of what a simulation computer would be yes yes I I you know it's um it's it's pretty like you know you can you can uh go really sci-fi on this and and it's like where where is it headed right like yeah um you know if we if we


00:38:05 - 00:40:18
give it um enough tools like let's say uh you can I can I can drop it and and slack and instead of interfacing with it in this fashion I want to interface with it in a totally autonomous way so we actually have this feature coming up where instead of me testing it we give it another agent so here you know instead of me interfacing with it and saying you know the um this is running or not running we can give it another agent that is actually testing the application um and so and then let's say interfaced with it entirely through slack and I'll say something like um get me uh uh you know give me Taylor Swift tickets the the moment they land and so it'll build a an app uh that continuously monitors the web for for when ter Swift uh uh to gets land and there's like an agent that's using the app uh to be able to get that and then one and and you can imagine it has it has some kind of wallet or credit card and then the moment it lands it it kind of gets it I mean what I'm trying to say


00:39:13 - 00:41:44
is that software like agents being able to do software is how AI gets more General because software runs Our Lives runs the internet runs our businesses and so the more competent AI becomes that software the more General they are in terms of what they can do okay this can go in so many directions I'm going to bring us back to the implications for people building product say product managers Founders how does this change that function that skill set like what skills do you see will matter more matter less which functions are maybe in some danger and they should start thinking about a different career path what one interesting Persona that we're seeing is the CEO the CEO of uh startup the CEO of you know uh you know Andrew uh Wilkinson from from Tiny is is a big user um and so these people are are typically you creatives right they built a company they hired people a lot of them like can't code a lot of them are are designers or product managers or or something else and and they you can


00:40:28 - 00:42:24
imagine a bottleneck you can imagine a bunch of ideas in their head uh and the ideas have to translate through them talking and then someone else listening to them and like assuming that someone else actually understands what they say and then that's someone else going and trying to build what they want to what they want built and also assuming that person has has time right because a lot of times your engineers are kind of stuck building the current thing they're not thinking about the future thing and so so uh what gets me excited is a lot of these CEOs are building the the future concept the next comp the next product they're going to build the next you know say company they're going to build and so uh it unlocks uh the creativity and again sort of unblocks them from that and look it's you know it's a V1 of the product but it can push things forward you can touch it you can feel it you can say okay this is this really has legs and and we should we should work on it you give it to your


00:41:26 - 00:44:12
engineers and they can they can improve on it from there so that's uh that's one Persona uh but I'm really excited about it the CEO founder um in uh in sort of uh uh companies um what one of the things that that I think is sort of hard about tech tech companies is uh sort of these silos between um designers uh product managers and and and engineers and you know everyone feels that pain of kind of we have low bandwidth communication which is which is language which then text on on slack and and zoom calls and it leads to a lot of frustration because it's really easy to misinterpret uh people and again leads to sort of siloing where where people working on on something and then you pass it on to the to the next team and it's not really what they what they expect that happens a lot between designers and Engineers um but like the common language that that um that everyone shares is code right like ultimately uh in software tech companies everything that we're talking about need to


00:42:49 - 00:45:12
eventually flush out in terms of code and so so what if the language becomes actually working prototypes and working app applications um for example we have a figma extension that translate um uh you know figma MOX into into react that runs on on repet so instead of instead of um you know giving giving the engineers you know just just mocks or screenshots whatever you just say oh here's here's a bunch of react code you know just make sure it runs on our infrastructure but like don't mess with it don't move the pixels around right um and and so I think it it just like opens uh opens up uh you know as silos of the companies make communication around around product a lot more concrete because I can I can give you a working uh prototype and that'll change how how people work like if you if you can imagine that everyone can can make software it's really kind of a radical reimagining of not just what tech companies are but really what what most companies are because because you


00:44:00 - 00:46:14
know everyone can be more more General so say you're PM listening to this an engineer designer what skills do you think if you were one of these folks if you were in building repet right now what kind of skills would you suggest folks focus on more and which you think are just like okay that's going to be less valuable in the future don't worry about these sorts of things and you can either pick one of those three functions or all three I think uh uh very important scale that that's like perhaps harder to develop but it's worth working on is being generative being more generative um being able to generate uh new ideas uh quickly because you know you can think about it as as like a factory line right like so so you have ideas uh you have the the production of of these of these ideas or like the initial kind of production uction of of these ideas and then you have you know other people that want to consume these ideas or work with you on these on these ideas and so typically


00:45:07 - 00:47:45
you're bottlenecked by by the middle kind of part where your ideas are kind of like that a lot of them and they're not fitting in because like they need to be made and they need to be made quickly and so now you open up that bottleneck so now like actually making things uh is is a lot easier actually you become limited by how fast you can generate ideas um and so uh and I find that true of of myself as well like you know I I consider myself uh quite generative but but now I have this tool and I can like build build a lot more and explore a lot more and I'm I'm finding that uh well actually I'm running out of ideas sometimes and so and so so you know training that uh that muscle I think is a is a good thing um I I think like learning a little bit of coding and like not the traditional way of learning coding like when you go like if you go to like a coding boot camp they're going to start with like what is git actually my co-founder ha uh was a designer when we're first building ret


00:46:27 - 00:48:39
together uh she went to to uh web web assembly uh to do like a coding course um and the first day they were like spent this whole time on git and she's like yeah what is that like what does it do like I'm like I still don't know what get exactly does but uh it's it's like um you're you're inverting the process like you're giving the the tool before the actual problem and so I think all of that stuff you don't have to worry about so things that you don't have to worry about I think a lot of the you know as a PM as a designer as someone who's not like in your code editor every day don't worry about all the tooling and if you learn uh a little bit of coding just by you know talking to an AI doing a little bit of debugging building something with repet you know running into a problem and trying to fix it just using AI you'll learn a bit of coding and you know I have this um I have this it's been called uh not by me dubbed as I'm Jed's law which is um the


00:47:32 - 00:49:44
return on investment for learn a code is doubling every six months um and really just learning a little bit of that skill learning a bit of skill about how to you know prompt uh AI how to read code and be able to debug it every every six months that's netting you more and more power uh because you're going to be able to create a lot more you're going to be able it's going to be easier to create you're going to be able to create a lot you know uh a lot more complete uh things um so so that's that's another uh scale that I think uh could be could be necessary this is super interesting okay so this last point you made on J's law uh it's interesting because when people like as someone's listening to this I could see them being like Engineers are in trouble why do you need at this point they're these agents are building the code your point is specific engineering skills are going to be incredibly valuable and more and more how often are they doubling would you


00:48:39 - 00:50:44
say every year you said no I every six months every six months these specific engineering skills are becoming more valuable and the idea is this you don't need to like know everything you don't need to know the foundation like to build the app as much it's more to un unblock the agent and understand the mental model of how this stuff is built so you can move forward fast that's right that's right understanding the basic components of it I would say yes so it's like we need new engineering schools to teach you these very specific skills yes versus spending years on like algorithm algorithms and and I think I think no one has done that yet right and I think this is this is like a you know big business probably ready like to get built as like uh AI native coding it's totally different than than like traditional coding yeah U that's why on Hacker News there's so much skepticism about like AI native coding tools because they're like yeah it's a it's a


00:49:41 - 00:51:35
glorified autocomplete and I understand like if you're you know writing operating system kernels you know it's not really doing that much for you but if you're Building Product it's building it for you at this at this at this point right and so you know if if you're if you're starting a school to to teach AI native coding you would skip so much of computer science and the and the basic tools and uh you would you would teach the basic idea of how to structure an app and then you would teach prompting uh and then you would teach I think a little bit of debugging I think debugging is quite a quite a good skill right now to learn and interestingly if you want to be good at debugging you like there's a lot you need to understand which is basically what you're saying is like that's the subset of things to understand it's things that break and to do that you have to understand how it all works what are servers what apis all these things okay how far so we've been talking about


00:50:38 - 00:52:43
how this is very good right now building a prototype building a V1 MVP people can use it you can deploy you deploy this app people can start using it and there's like a scale it can reach do you see a future where you can build like a Salesforce size business fully replit or other tools that can scale to hundreds of billions of dollars of value or is there just going to always be some limit of like you need like actual engineers and designers sitting on this thing building it thinking it awesome if like my law is like you know directionally correct even even if the months are not uh are not exactly correct that the duration is correct you're going to see a compounding effect of of the power like it's actually quite hard to convince yourself but if you really convince yourself that we are on a massive scale of improvement in in AI then then then the answer is yes and and it's it's like absurd to my engineering mind that I'm saying this but you know Rikers well this like you know futurist


00:51:41 - 00:53:44
um you know talks about how exponentials are really hard for humans to to grasp and so actually when we started building the agent um you know I I told the team it's easy and we've fallen in the trp before it's easy to build and optimize for today you know in in 22 we built like um you know coped like thing and autocomplete we trained our own models we optimized the hell out of them but at some point like that modality was kind of you know not the right modality which is like the autocomplete modality and the right modality is actually this I think for now uh as being able to to chat inside the programming environment and and for the agent to to create things for you but in order for us to uh make that bat you know a year ago uh the models were actually not there like the models could not do this but we were like okay we're going to build for the models that are landing in six months and it truly like six months later the models started to land that that are capable of this of the reasoning that we


00:52:43 - 00:54:57
need and whatever and say that was like you know son it V1 which is oh wow like we switched to it and the reasoning improved so much and 6 months later you have son V2 um and so it's really almost like a six Monon Cadence and so if if we're really on the on this trajectory then then you know I would say you know next year you're able to to scale maybe maybe you get you know thousands of users paying you uh the AI can do maintenance you know we already showed the AI doing like SQL queries and doing migrations um so they will be able to do maintenance debugging things like that um I think where it gets really tough is that you know uh when you're hitting scale and you want to architect A system that is resilient um so that means uh you know you would start you know charting databases and you would start like using different Q systems and components and and things like that and I think uh you know the AI needs to have access to the entire Suite of of tools to be able to do this and and and I


00:53:50 - 00:56:01
think that that's going to be the next bottleneck and I think the AI needs to get be a lot more reliable uh at at doing that but I could imagine like whatever five years from now uh someone running you know a billion dollar company with zero employees where it's like the support is handled by AI the development is handled by AI um and and and and you're you're just you're just you're just building and and and creating this thing that is you know that people are finding valuable on are are paying you for it that being said it's worth like thinking about the economics of it like if the you know if the cost of software goes down a lot like uh then what is uh you know what is the the price that you can charge on on software right so can you actually build the next Salesforce if anyone can generate Salesforce you know and then and then the question is like what is the you know and this is why I emphasize being generative because I think then the the thing that would make you better


00:54:55 - 00:56:51
is like by being able to iterate and improve the thing really quickly and generate new ideas and stay ahead of all the other people building these tools so quickly yeah oh my god um an interesting other kind of mental model I'm I'm seeing as you talk about this sort of thing uh is not to offend religious folks but there's this concept of God of the gaps I imagine you've heard that yes where it's like God explains all the things that we don't yet understand and over time that kind of space shrinks and God's like all the things we don't get yet those gaps that was God that's that's what that that's that proves there there needs to be a God and it feels like right now humans are like the gaps in these tools yes where these agents you talk about that you can hire within repet are like fixing these little gaps and over time AI will fix these things themselves that's right and these gaps will shrink I mean unless unless uh we hit some fundamental limit and the current


00:55:52 - 00:58:10
regime of of of AI which you know I'm not I'm not an expert about like how far Transformers could could scale but I I feel like it is you know we found the thing that could that could scale pretty far but maybe there are limitations in data or or other things like that that we could be we could be surprised by but if there isn't then we are on a massive trajectory of removing these gaps uh quickly yeah very true we have no idea we keep thinking it's just going to keep going but maybe maybe it'll stop at some point I could keep going and going uh but I think we should also let people go play with these things and process all the things we've been talking about uh is there anything else that you think might be helpful for folks to think about or learn or study you know I'll give advice to to sort of um Founders or or leaders at at companies um the way we work is is going to change rapidly and it's important to be sort of resilient to that that that change one


00:57:02 - 00:59:11
thing that I think is really difficult now is having road maps especially if you're doing anything in AI but really any anything that AI could affect you want to be able to react to it really quickly and so you know when the um anthropic dropped the computer use um uh sort of capability you know we slotted on our road map because we don't really have it explicit road map we we like immediately jumped on it and started building things and we launched some things around it uh we're going to be doing more with it but like there's going to be capabilities that that are going to drop and you you want to really uh in some cases if it really affects your business you want to be able to jump on it really really quickly so so being agile not being sort of stuck with with road maps being able to kind of just just say oh we're just going to just going to switch priorities right away uh is going to be uh super important not being uh you know like I said with silos um at repet there's so many people that


00:58:06 - 01:00:18
are on on the scale of like you know designer to engineer designer to product manager actually I mentioned Alman earlier he started as a designer at repet and now as a product manager we have people who start as um uh designers become engineers and we have people in the middle and we're comfortable with that like design engineers um and that fit at different parts of the scale and the the design Engineers go to the design crit meetings and and some designers go to the engineering meetings and you just got you got to be fluid right because you know again when when designers can code and uh and Engineers can design I mean it's it's really becomes it you can't have a lot of structure around that so you want to build a culture and you want to build uh a a environment or milu that is like really really flexible um which is uncomfortable for a lot of people man the future is wild everyone's everyone's a hybrid person now uh let me just actually double down on what you just said which I think is


00:59:12 - 01:01:10
really interesting it's almost like if you're an engineer where your skill set will become most valuable is unblocking these AI tools and knowing debugging and figuring out how to unblock allow it to go further and further and further within pm and Design Land Based on what you're describing where the skills will become more valuable is uh generating ideas almost like finding opportunities Discovery finding what problems need to be solved and then articulating that as clearly as possible to the AI tooling that's right super yeah this is this is a very crisp sort of advice that that people can follow today I think oh man what a world okay uh I'm jot this is incredible uh my mind is racing I got to go build some apps immediately give us feedback that I will do that so just to leave listeners with a couple things one is just what should they know should where do they find you where do they how do they try replit anything else other than just going to rep.com yeah just go


01:00:11 - 01:02:15
to rep.com it's it's an open Beta right now we're we're kind of uh quickly um improving it going to exit beta I think in a in a in a few weeks but if if you're comfortable testing something that's like not not perfect go to rep.com uh if you uh subscribe to our uh core plan you should be able to access the agent and start using it um and we are uh you know I think the place where we're most active is Twitter so Twitter are like x uh the handle repet RIT or my handle uh aad oh yeah one other thing I wanted to make sure we had a chance to touch on is you're working on something new something that's coming in the very near future maybe the day this episode drops talk about that all right so depending on when when the episode is is coming out this could be the F first time people he hear about it but um we have this product called called Agent it is sort of high agency it does everything from setting up the project and and all of that right and so now we


01:01:12 - 01:03:13
have we're we're uh we're working on assistant so assistant is uh like let's say the the cousin of agent it is a little less powerful but a lot more controllable so you can like Focus focus on uh features or areas of the code that you you want to change and you still don't have to know how to code but it is a lot more manageable and it is a lot faster so you saw how it like it took some time to kind of create the project and code some of the things assistant is in the order of milliseconds and seconds to be able to respond to you uh and so again as you know as I talk about the idea of tools we want people to have as much uh Power and autonomy as possible and so there there are certain instances where where agent is the best it's gonna do the debugging for you it's going to create the database for you but if you want more control assistant is uh is going to give you that just so folks totally understand what this is going to do for them what's like the mental model


01:02:13 - 01:04:26
for what this is like if it's like a person helping you out agent uh is like um you know having a developer uh work you give you give them the PRD right and and and they're going to go and and and built the thing um assistant is like you're sitting next to them so so you you know they they built the thing uh and now you walk over to their to their desk and you say let me move this button three three pixel to the left let me um you know change this thing so like small increments of changes that you want happen really quickly and you want it reliably uh that will give you that so um it's just like much faster iteration on UI and and things things like that incredible the future is Wild final question I always ask everybody how can listeners be useful to you come work at repet we have we have a PM rooll I think uh up if if you're product manager oh uh we're hiring engineers and and and and and product managers so so come work at repet or refer some of the repl especially if you're like our tools and


01:03:20 - 01:04:53
you want them to to get better the best way to to do that is to to to get us great people we can hire well you're about to get a flood of product managers applying amazing I love that good luck I'm J thank you so much for being here this was incredible thank you thank you for for your podcast and the community that you built and and newsletter and everything it's it's been it's been awesome to watch thanks man appreciate that bye everyone thank you so much for listening if you found this valuable you can subscribe to the show on Apple podcast Spotify or your favorite podcast app also please consider giving us a rating or leaving a review as that really helps other listeners find the podcast you can find all past episodes or learn more about the show at Lenny podcast.com see you in the next episode
