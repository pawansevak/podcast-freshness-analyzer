These are cutting-edge insights from late 2024/early 2025 that will age quickly as the AI landscape evolves rapidly.",

  "insight_reasoning": "Several genuinely non-obvious insights that would surprise experienced PMs, particularly around how product development bottlenecks shift when 90% of code is AI-generated (from engineering time to merge queues and decision-making), and the counterintuitive finding that product leverage comes more from working with researchers than UX improvements. However, some content still falls into familiar territory around AI capabilities and strategy.",
