The specific application to AI products is moderately fresh but not cutting-edge.",

  "insight_reasoning": "While the systematic approach to AI product evaluation is useful, most insights are adaptations of well-known data science techniques. The 'benevolent dictator' concept and specific workflow are somewhat valuable, but an experienced PM would recognize these as standard qualitative analysis methods applied to a new domain.",
