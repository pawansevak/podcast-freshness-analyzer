  "insight_reasoning": "While there are some useful tactical details and specific examples, most insights fall into familiar startup advice categories. The onboarding focus, word-of-mouth emphasis, and founder marketing concepts are well-covered topics. The execution details are solid but not paradigm-shifting for experienced PMs.",
