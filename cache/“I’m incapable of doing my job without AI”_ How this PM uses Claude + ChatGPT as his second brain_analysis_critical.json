  "freshness_reasoning": "Contains some recent references to current AI tools (Claude projects, GPT voice mode, Reddit API scraping) and reflects 2024-2025 AI product management practices. However, the core concepts of using AI as a thought partner and context management aren't cutting-edge anymore.",
  "insight_score": 5,
  "insight_reasoning": "While the specific implementation details are useful, most insights fall into familiar territory - using AI for research, feedback coaching, and interview prep. The Reddit scraping workflow is moderately interesting but not paradigm-shifting for experienced PMs who've heard similar automation stories.",
