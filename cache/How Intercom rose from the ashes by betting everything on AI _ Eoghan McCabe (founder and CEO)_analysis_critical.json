References current AI competitive landscape, recent pricing model changes, and emerging organizational structures around AI agents that are still being figured out industry-wide.",
  "insight_score": 7,
  "insight_reasoning": "Contains several genuinely surprising insights that contradict conventional wisdom - like charging 99 cents per ticket when costs were $1.20, the counterintuitive finding that AI can be more 'personal' than humans, and specific data about 40% employee turnover being necessary for transformation. However, some advice about founder mode and working hard falls into familiar territory.",

      "insight": "Intercom initially lost money on every AI transaction (charged 99 cents, cost $1.20) but committed to outcome-based pricing anyway, believing costs would drop faster than value perception - and it worked",
      "timestamp": "23:29",
      "why_valuable": "Directly contradicts standard advice to price above costs. Shows how betting on cost curves declining can enable breakthrough pricing models that seem impossible initially.",

      "insight": "AI agents can be more 'personal' than humans because they provide instant, expert, consistent service 24/7 versus making customers wait 2-4 days for 'crappy canned responses' from humans",
      "timestamp": "14:04",
      "why_valuable": "Completely flips the conventional wisdom that human touch is always more personal. Reframes 'personal' as reliability and expertise rather than human connection.",

      "insight": "Successful AI transformation required 40% employee turnover and a 'sharp knife' values rewrite designed specifically to cut out ineffective parts of the company",

      "insight": "Future organizations will have agents at the highest levels too - like AI chief of staff that understands priorities, does daily check-ins, and organizes accountability across the company",
      "timestamp": "43:11",
      "why_valuable": "Challenges assumption that AI will only replace IC roles. Suggests even executive support functions could be automated, which most leaders haven't considered.",

      "insight": "The only way to compete with AI startups is to literally work 12 hours a day, 365 days a year, because that's what all the young AI founders are doing - or hire a young CEO to do it",
