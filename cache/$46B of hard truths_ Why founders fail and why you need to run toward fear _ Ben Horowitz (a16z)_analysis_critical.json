  "freshness_reasoning": "While the podcast contains some recent references to current companies like OpenAI and Cursor, most of the content consists of timeless leadership and management advice that could have been recorded years ago. The stories and frameworks discussed are largely evergreen rather than tied to recent developments or emerging trends.",

  "insight_reasoning": "The podcast contains several genuinely valuable insights that go beyond typical startup advice, particularly around the psychology of decision-making under pressure and the counterintuitive nature of hiring senior executives. However, much of the content still falls into familiar categories of leadership wisdom, even if articulated with more specificity and personal examples than usual.",
