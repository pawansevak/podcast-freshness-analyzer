🆕 UNIQUE INSIGHTS FEATURE - UPDATE GUIDE
=========================================

NEW FEATURE: Unique Insights with Exact Quotes
-----------------------------------------------

The Podcast Analyzer now extracts and displays unique insights with 
exact quotes from the podcast transcript!

WHAT'S NEW?
-----------

✨ **Unique Insights Section**
   - Automatically identifies 5 most impactful insights
   - Shows exact quotes from the transcript
   - Categorizes each insight by type

📋 **Insight Types:**
   - 🔬 Data-Backed Insight: Claims with specific numbers/research
   - 💡 Counter-intuitive Finding: Surprising or unexpected perspectives
   - 🎯 Novel Framework: New mental models or patterns
   - 💭 Key Insight: Important points worth noting

🎨 **Beautiful UI:**
   - Green accent cards for each insight
   - Large quotation marks for visual appeal
   - Type badges for quick identification
   - Italic quotes for readability


HOW TO USE
----------

1. **Start the Server** (if not already running):
   ```bash
   cd podcast-analyzer\ 3
   source venv/bin/activate
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Open in Browser**: http://localhost:8000

3. **Select and Analyze** any podcast

4. **Scroll down** to see the new "💡 Unique Insights with Quotes" section!


WHAT YOU'LL SEE
---------------

After the "Top Highlights" section, you'll now see a new section with:

Example from Tech Podcast:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 💡 Unique Insights with Quotes                              │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ [COUNTER-INTUITIVE FINDING]                                 │
│ "That's where it gets counterintuitive. The bottleneck      │
│  isn't the AI's capability anymore—it's our ability to      │
│  articulate what we want..."                                │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ [DATA-BACKED INSIGHT]                                       │
│ "We ran an A/B test with our team over three months.        │
│  The spec-first features had 42% fewer post-deployment      │
│  bugs and took 30% less time to ship..."                    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘


HOW IT WORKS
------------

The analyzer looks for:
✓ Keywords indicating insights ("counterintuitive", "surprising", "interesting")
✓ Data claims (percentages, studies, research)
✓ Novel frameworks ("pattern", "model", "framework")
✓ Important statements ("key insight", "important", "non-obvious")

Then extracts the exact quote and categorizes it.


TESTING THE FEATURE
-------------------

1. **Quick Test - Command Line:**
   ```bash
   python demo.py
   ```
   You'll see insights printed with quotes for all 3 podcasts

2. **Full Test - Web Interface:**
   - Start the app: `python app.py`
   - Analyze podcast_1 (Tech/AI) - Should show 5 unique insights
   - Analyze podcast_2 (Generic) - Shows fewer quality insights
   - Analyze podcast_3 (Science) - Should show research-based insights


CLEARING CACHE
--------------

Since this is a new feature, you may want to clear old cached results:

```bash
rm cache/*.json
```

This forces re-analysis with the new insight extraction.


CUSTOMIZING
-----------

To adjust what gets extracted as insights, edit `analyzer.py`:

1. **Change insight keywords** (line ~180):
   ```python
   insight_keywords = [
       'counterintuitive', 'surprising', 'unexpected',
       'interesting', 'novel', 'key insight'
       # Add your own keywords here
   ]
   ```

2. **Adjust number of insights** (line ~220):
   ```python
   if len(unique_insights) < 5:  # Change from 5 to any number
   ```

3. **Modify quote length** (line ~210):
   ```python
   "quote": quote[:300]  # Change from 300 to any length
   ```


EXAMPLES BY PODCAST TYPE
-------------------------

📱 **Tech/AI Podcast** (podcast_1):
   - Shows data on cost reduction, performance metrics
   - Counter-intuitive takes on AI capabilities
   - Novel frameworks like "specification-first development"

📊 **Generic Productivity** (podcast_2):
   - Fewer unique insights (expected for generic content)
   - Shows basic advice statements
   - Demonstrates the analyzer can distinguish quality

🔬 **Science Research** (podcast_3):
   - Research findings with percentages
   - Counter-intuitive discoveries about adult learning
   - Specific data from studies


WHAT'S NEXT?
------------

Future enhancements:
- Click to highlight quote location in full transcript
- Filter insights by type
- Export insights to note-taking apps
- Link insights to YouTube timestamps (when YT integration added)
- Use LLM to better extract and summarize insights


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

❌ "No insights showing"
   → Clear cache: `rm cache/*.json`
   → Re-analyze the podcast

❌ "Quotes look truncated"
   → This is intentional (300 char limit)
   → Adjust in analyzer.py if needed

❌ "Generic content shows many insights"
   → The extractor is liberal - it captures potential insights
   → The quality is reflected in the insight_score instead


FEEDBACK
--------

The insight extraction uses keyword matching and heuristics.
For production, you'd want to:

1. Use Claude API to intelligently extract insights
2. Ask it to identify truly novel/surprising points
3. Have it explain why each insight is valuable

This would give much higher quality results than the current
keyword-based approach, which is optimized for the demo.
